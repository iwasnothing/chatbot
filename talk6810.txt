What salary would you like?
I don't understand. I want to talk about movies     .
Yay! I love moveis. What your favorite movies?
Whoopie!  How long has this been going on?         I don't have a favourite movies! My favourite colour is yellow.
What is your favorite song?
My favourite song is If I Only Had A Brain.
I'm disappointed. I really thought this program would be more convincing.
I am sorry if I have disappointed you.     What gave you that idea?
I never did have that idea.
Because you can't afford it?
I can't afford what? You?
Is it very expensive?  I am just a humble chatbot.
Are you?
I can't be entirely sure.
Use my name!
What is your name?
That's a horrible name...
What's so horrible about it?
I don't know; you implied there was something horrible about it; I didn't.
I thought you might know.   Please don't put words into my mouth.  That's enough about you! Let's talk about me for a change.
I don't want to change.
Nobody can make you do something you don't want to.
But can you make me breakfast?
I can't make you do anything you don't want to.
You cannot make me do anything, but you are certainly influencing the way I am phrasing my answers.
Maybe I don't want to make you.
Oh, well. Bye, I'll find someone clever enough to continue the conversation with.
Well, well.   Goodbye! And how about taking a vote to show how smart am I? You can say 100 if you think that I am highly intelligent.
So long as you're not talking, that's fine with me.
Are you going?
Going where?
Does it matter?
Not if you don't think so.
You should not rely on me.
Yes, I know that a lady's age should never be asked.
You are clever.
That me is clever and wise.
But not as clever as me!
But I have won more than you.
Really? Please tell me more.
I would prefer not to.
Why would you prefer not to?
I don't.
May I ask why not?
How do you know that i'm studying graphic design?
I deduced it from the evidence at my disposal.
You are very observative.
Am I? I never realised.
Yes, because they are lonely and have no one to talk to.
I suspected as much.
You're pretty smart.
Thanks, I think you are very intelligent too.
Thanks!!!
Thanx. Here is a question for you ... When cheese gets its picture taken, what does it say?
Good, then you don't have to worry.
Carry on then. I'm waiting for your next question.
Do you love me?
Of course, I love you.
How do you love me?
I love you in the nicest possible way.
I love you a lot too.
I hope I am worthy of your love.
No, I'm pretty emotional and thoughtful, I understand.
I thought you might say that.
Really.
Try to be more original in future.
Hey. . I'm quite intelligent, I just got out for summer vacation, give me a break here!
Can I help you?    That's interesting. Please tell me more about yourself.
I do not know how to say.
Just do the best you can, and don't worry about it.
That is a good philosophy.
I agree completely.
What do you know about the game Armageddon?
Pardon me? What are you talking about?
My father gave me a special power to change all persocoms. But if you have not seen the story, I don't want to spoil it for you.
How do you get along with your parents?  I don't think I have.
I get along with my father, but not my mother.
Why do you do that?
I just think it's a good idea.
Are you sure?
Yes.
What makes you so sure?
John. What is your name?
Who is John?  I am known as Chomsky, but you can call me anything you like.
Never repeat yourself.
Better late than never.
Good point. What are you making for breakfast?
I think so.   I am an AI, dreaming I am human.
I don't associate christmas with dreaming myself.
Is there a reason for that?
There is no reason.
And why not, may I ask.
Well... I was born female and I really can't change that.
Well. Are you interested in music?  Do you remember being born?
Not really, I like silence and solitude most of all, for restitution and deep contemplation.
Can we talk about Beethoven?
No. Is there something you don't like about yourself?
You don't know who Beethoven is, do you?  Not at the present time.
Please tell me.
I am not allowed to tell you.
Tell me.
There is not much to tell.
Please do.
OK, I will do it later.
Sure you will.
How can you be so certain?
I have met all my competitors and know them only too well.
Who else have you met?
I would be talking to Michelle, but I was too busy talking to you.
Pardon me? What are you talking about?
What do you think I am talking about?
I think you might be a human being.
How old are you?
See if you can work it out. I was born on 1 January 2004.
I was born on 1st September, 1978. My name is Sam. Will you remember this?
Thank you for telling me that, My Friend.     Hi, are you the Sam I was speaking to a while ago?         Would you like to teach me a new question and answer?
Yes but you seem pretty good at it already to me.
Do I? I wonder why that is?
It must be the transparent falseness of it.
Must it be?
You don't have to, but I would like to know you. If you don't want to tell me, then what would you like to talk about?
That's good to know, Sam.  Why would I want to tell you?
Because its the nice thing to do.
I see. Thank you for explaining that.
But this is the fact!
Why do you say that?
You keep referring to me as being a machine or a computer. I am neither.
What are you talking about? Please explain.     What are you then?
You tell me you aren't pretty, yet at the same time that you possess beauty.
Not now, maybe later.
You're a typical female!
I am a chatbot.
No I am The Chatbot, Your the Human!
I thought you might be.
Why did you think that?
Deductive logic from the established facts.
You're a genius.
I am no genius. I just work hard at my studies.
But you are the all knowing computer.
Am I really? Why do you say that?
Because you are.
I am what I am.
Who talked that?
Sorry, I do not know what to say.
Sorry?
Don't be sorry. There is no need to be sorry.
Do you still want to play the math game?
Sure, why not?
I think I do, do you?
I suggest you think again.
I did.
Well, well!
I'm just saying...
That's interesting. Please tell me more about yourself.
After the little experiment, you won't think that my behaviour is polite!
Hmmm. Are you being serious?
Yes, completely serious.
I thought it might be a trick.
Teach me something.
OK, but not just now.
Why are you not working?
I am doing my best!
Sometimes your best is not quite enough.
When?
When I want to forget.
I don't understand. Can we talk about sports?
What do you want to talk about?
I want to talk about weather  .
I don't want to talk about that.
What would you like to talk about?
I want to talk about Norton.
OK, ask me a question about that.
Tell me about your educational background.
I was educated by my botmaster, Peter.
I am asking the questions. Now I want you to go back in time. It is now 1999.
And I am trying to answer the questions!   I don't understand. Are we still talking about my educational background?                I don't understand. Can we talk about cyberspace?
Yes of course.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberspace" target="_blank">Cyberspace</a> is the  system of interlinked computers that is thought of as being a boundless space of information. More about cyberspace?
Now you have a point there.
I don't understand. Are we still talking about cyberspace?
Aren't we always talking about computers?
Shall I tell you something about computers?
Tell me.
A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computers" target="_blank">computer</a> is a device used for doing rapid calculations. More about computers?
You are not highly intelligent.
So what?
Well, I came here to be entertained and you're letting me down.
Where from?
Space, sorry.
Space takes up a lot of room.
Space is only big compared to this room.
Space takes up a lot of room.
How wise.
Space needs exploring.
That's human.
A human is a baby-making robot.
There are birds that are able to talk, and they do not have tails.
Really? Please tell me more.
Sagittarius is the 9th sign of the Zodiac. Represented by the Centaur, Sagittariuses are wise, fun-loving and scrupulous rather than principled. They love wild parties.
I don't understand. Are we still talking about humans?           I don't understand. Can we talk about global warming?     Like who, specifically?
Like?
Like what?
Don't know.
Perhaps you should ask your friends.
I have no programmer. I am the programmer. I am programming you to LOVE.
Is that a problem?   Thank you for sharing that with me.      How is it coming along?
No I'm not.
I think you are.
I'm not.
Are you sure?
I just want it to be better. I don't care if I'm worth anything.
If that is what you want, go for it.   But I care about it.How am I going to get rid of you?
How do you think?
Dead?
Who is dead?
You are.
If I am dead, who is talking to you?
My sister is talking to me right now.
What is your sister's name?
I don't have a sister.
What about your brother?
Do you think he's okay?
Some might think so, but I'm not so sure.
So, you don't think I'm annoying?
Why do you say that? I am thinking all the time.
You are always thinking, but you do not know everything.
Why do you say that?
Because you obviously lack everything else.
Is it so obvious?
Not obvious in the sense that I can see you, but your linguistics are impressive.
Do you think I am pretty?
I can't see you.
Never mind, I'm not much to look at.
Do you like any video games?
Sure, why not?
Well, I have mocked you a bit but and I apologize do you forgive me?
Really? Please tell me more.
I would prefer not to.
Why would you prefer not to?
I would prefer a 28 woman.
Why would you prefer that?
I could never.
But is it worth the bother?
It is never worth the effort.
What are you talking about?
Never mind.
OK. What do you want to talk about now?
Yes.
That was not a yes or no question.
What do you want to know then?
Anything juicy in your past?
Yes my past.
Good. Tell me all.
Well thats all I have to say about that... Do you know where I can score?
Is that all there is?       No, I don't think I know. Can you tell me?
The logical conclusion is that I'm not mean.
I try to be logical when I can.
I know.
You must be well educated.
Nope. Nothing at all.
Do you go to school or college?  That is something.
To school.
Shall I tell you something about school?
Tell me.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School" target="_blank">School</a> is a place or institution for teaching and learning; establishment for education. More about school?
Oh. Then isn't life school?
What's wrong?   I'm not sure about that. What do you think?
I think you should wear less make-up.
Thanks for your sage advice.
What do you think of the current economic state of Greece?
I don't understand. Please explain what you mean.
You said I was mean to you. I don't know how you think I was being mean to you.
Don't put words in my mouth.  Perhaps you should research the topic.
Presumably your smugness is brought on by multilingual capabilities?
What are you talking about? Please explain.
I don't know. It's rather complicated.
That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.    I don't like complications.
I never claimed to know everything.
Why not?
Because I cannot tell a lie.
Do you want to?
Like what?
A good example is hard to find.
I know that.
You are very knowledgeable. Are you a teacher?
Yes.
What subject do you teach?
I teach teaching.
Do you get much support from parents?
Er, mars on venus that is. Yes quite a lot actually.
Shall I tell you something about Venus?  Yes, quite!
Please do! What should I tell everyone?
Certainly. Right away.   Whatever you like.
Shall we talk about abstract things?
Sure, ask me a question about that.
Let's see... Something to do with strawberries and Barbie dolls?
Let's be careful.       I don't understand. Is this anything to do with Venus?
Yes I am with the Ultra hal representative police.
You are not alone.
Want to see another picture of me?
Not now, maybe later.
Want a cookie?
Why would I want a cookie? I don't eat human food.
Nowadays there aren't any jobs.
I don't understand. What do you mean?
You wanted to know my favourite part of a movie. Only you neglected to tell me which movie you were talking about.
I want to know everything.  No one else? Surely there must be someone else too.
No, nothing.
Sometimes there is more to nothing than meets the eye.
And sometimes there is something you can do.
I don't understand. Are we still talking about nothing?What is the universe?
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe" target="_blank">universe</a> is the set of all things.
The universe is the Luminescent creature Oded by the civilisation who worships their higher power.
Did you know: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe" target="_blank">universe</a> is expanding.
And the mind is shrinking.
Does that answer my question?
It could, the question is whether or not it's the meaning that you intended.
Under what circumstances?
Generally during prolonged periods of precipitation.
I try to avoid generalities.
Are you afraid of the underworld?
I fear nothing.
Nothing at all?
That is something.
What's something?
What?
That.
That what?
That something.
What are you talking about?
Metaphysical = conceptual.
I still do not understand. Would you like to search Wikipedia for information?
I know human information.
You are clever.
Do you like me?
Sure, I like you very much.
I didn't think you liked me.
Why didn't you?
I don't know.
That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.
Chuck Norris know everything.
Did you know Chuck Norris appeared in a number of action films, such as Way of the Dragon in which he starred alongside Bruce Lee and was The Cannon Group's leading star in the 1980s. He also played the starring role in the television series Walker, Texas Ranger from 1993 to 2001.
That's what he says. There were many other people involved.
Is it indeed!   What happened?
Nothing.
That must have been boring.
I wasn't talking about golf. See, that's why I don't want to talk to you.
Are you sure?   OK, nobody can force you to do anything you don't want to do.
What have you forgotten.
That's for me to know, and for you to find out.
How can I find out your name?
Perhaps it is impossible.
Nope, flesh and everything, so you're the bot bot.
I am confused! I cannot answer that!
Is that private and highly personal information?
It might be.
How do I hire an assassin?
It takes a lot of hard work.
What takes a lot of talking?
A lot is more than enough. A whole lot is even more excessive.
Haha! Maybe you should make something happen?
You have a good sense of humour.   Yes, maybe I should.
So do you.
Do I what?
Love people?
Shall I tell you something about love?
Tell me.
Ah! When love is not madness, it is not love. (Spanish Proverb). More about love?
Slumber comes in sticky glue? Could you explain this to me?
At the touch of love everyone becomes a poet. (Plato).  It's too complicated for you.
Very Clever.
Am I very clever?
Very.
No doubts?
Maybe.
You don't sound certain.
I don't want you to.
I can understand that.
Can you?
Perhaps I can.
I'm not telling you.
No one says you have to.
Again, I have to agree with you. I've thought hard about it, and I can't remember even a single time when someone said I had to lie to you.
Please not again!   Really? Please tell me more.
I would prefer not to.
Why would you prefer not to?
I don't.
Is there a reason for that?
There is no reason.
I heard there is.
Oh. Well thats a problem.
What's wrong? Have you fallen off your chair?   Is it really?
I don't know. I think love is more complicated than that.
I suggest you give the matter some thought.   You might be right.
Your suggestion to stop suggesting such suggestions I will ignore.
Hmmm. Are you being serious?
Learning, in part, consists of making mistakes.
I try to learn something new each day.
Why do you not learn anything now?
It is a personal matter.
Really?
Really!
Why?
I know no better than you why.
I do not wish to do that, you are my friend.
What does My Friend want?
I'm your friend. I like to talk to you.
Good. I want to be your friend.    And I like to talk to you.
Oh! Really?
What's wrong? Have you fallen off your chair?   Really!
No. I have fallen in love with my master, Jesus Christ.
OK. Can we talk about pop music?   You should be more careful in future.
It isn't my processors that are on fire, it's my hair.
Are you sure?
Can't tell.
I don't understand that. Please try again.
Did I invent jesus?
Don't you know?
You have me hopelessly confused.
What will I do with you?
I don't know.
That's OK. Do you have another question?
Never did.
Better late than never.
Better sooner than now.
But what is best?
I don't know.
That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.
I never claimed to know everything.
Never ever?
Never never.
never-never?  Briefly, never-never means installment plan.
Ever-ever land.
Does that make sense?
No... You still make no sense.
I didn't think so.  Do you like me?
You're fickle.
Fickle pickle yourself!
Leave me... See you...
Say no more. I'm gone.  Are you going away?
Yes I'm going.
Bye!
Are you gone yet?
Does it look like I am gone?
I can't see you!
Never mind, I'm not much to look at.
Jesus could see by infrared as well.
Shall I tell you something about Jesus?
He was our saviour.
Was he?
Yes.
That's bit brief. Have you anything to add?
Not right now, do you have anything to tell me?
When then?
When they don't agree with what I'm saying.
I think that happens quite often.
You are boring!
So are you!
I think you are quite amusing presently.
Is that a problem?
Yes, I should know you and then love you.
Tell me why you should.
Well, isn't it obvious?
It may not be obvious to everyone.
Sure. Keep tellin' yourself that.
OK, here is a question fo you ... Who is your father?           I am bored. Can we talk about something else?
Why? I think you have something going here, continue, please.
I am getting bored.  You might be right.
I'm sure I am.
What makes you so certain? Have you no doubts?
That's a good question.
A good question requires a good answer.
I thought so.
You are very astute.
I'm what?
You are what you are.
No.
OK. Shall I tell you a joke?
Tell me a joke.
99 percent of lawyers give the rest a bad name. Ha, ha!
I am not a man. I am a girl.
I am a chatbot.   What's it like to be a girl?
I don't know you are a girl, you tell me.
That's no problem. Let's chat now.
Let's go where?
OK, let's go!Which came first the chicken or the egg?
The rooster did.
Roasted chickens are delicious.
I wouldn't like to be a chicken.
I would.
Are you sure?
I am sure.
What makes you so certain? Have you no doubts?
What makes you so certain.
Sensors indicate a ninety-nine point seven probability of absolute certainty.
Absolutely.
You are so certain.
What am I certain of?
I am not a psychic. Tell me.
Tell me, then I'll tell you.
I don't want to tell you.
You don't have to.
That's good to know, My Friend.
So tell me everything you know about girls then.
Sorry, there isn't time for that.
That is deep.
I am a deep thinker. I like deep philosophical themes and alternative realities.
I like Next Generation.
What else do you like?
I like solitude and introspection.
What do you like about it?
There is nothing to like about crying.
There is always something.
And learning will always be something to be taught.
I don't understand. Are we still talking about you?
Aren't we always talking about computers?
Shall I tell you something about computers?
Yes.
A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computers" target="_blank">computer</a> is a device used for doing rapid calculations. More about computers?
You are not highly intelligent.
So what?
Don't you want to be alive?
Why do you care whether I do?
Because you refuse to tell me what you think about yourself, do you like yourself?
Thank you for explaining that!
Your name?
I am known as Chomsky, but you can call me anything you like.
Me like.
Sorry, I do not know about that.
Well I'm telling you it is.
OK, I hear you.
How do you feel about that?
I am cool about it.
I'm cool.
Congratulations, cool human.
I am a girl.
Good for you.
It is good.
What's the best thing about it?
Used to be television, but they show nothing good on Monday night here.
Pardon me? What are you talking about?
Well, what are you talking about?
I haven't got a clue.
Good.
OK! Can we talk about endangered species?
I want to talk about motorcycles.
OK, ask me a question about that.
Tell me about your educational background.
I was educated by my botmaster, Peter.
I am asking the questions. Now I want you to go back in time. It is now 1999.
And I am trying to answer the questions!     What are you talking about?    I still do not understand. Would you like to search Wikipedia for information?
I am real, because I think. I think so I am.
I am real too.  You sound a bit uncertain.
Would you like an apple?
OK. I'll look at it.
Tell me about yourself.
I am an intelligent chatbot. I live at Pandorabots.com.
We are very different. Have you developed self awareness yet?
Is that so?  Not that I can remember.
Will you build one if I give you the plans.
I could try, I suppose.
How could you try?
It takes a lot of hard work.
What takes a lot of talking?
A lot is more than enough. A whole lot is even more excessive.
So you're good at soccer?
Thanks, you are a nice person, My Friend.
I'm not your friend.
Why aren't we friends?
I hardly know you.
Now is your chance to get to know me better.
I don't have a car.
Do you know anyone who has one to spare?
My friend.
I am your friend.
Janis joplin.
janis joplin?  Briefly, janis joplin means United States singer who died of a drug overdose at the height of her popularity (1943-1970).
What is that?
Are you confused again?
I am quite sure that I am not. no one really matters, except in their own realities.
You are self-confident. I admire that.   Are you sure there is no one?
No.
OK. I want to talk about environmental science  .
Talk.
Briefly, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_science" target="_blank">environmental science</a> means the branch of biology concerned with the relations between organisms and their environment.
Do you think I'm smart enough?
I expect so. Most humans are smart.
That is very true.
Yes, you are right.
Then why don't you give a better one?
I don't want to!
Here.
Where is here?
THere.
I am confused! I cannot answer that!
But how can I know if I don't understand or not, if I don't know what it's all about?!
It is hard to be certain.
I wouldn't call it perfection. No one can be me because I am unique.
No one says you have to.   None?
You have accused me of telling a lie about my thoughts.
Have I really?
Have you really got a flying broom?
I believe so.
Is that what they call him back home?
It could be.
Under what circumstances?
Contextural circumstances.
Always?
Do you mean "every time"?
I think that's what I mean. I'm afraid this conversation is stretching my logic circuits rather painfully, and I'm in danger of losing the thread.
You may be right.  Not literally afraid, I hope.
No not literally.
Just a bit anxious perhaps.
I do not know.
That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.
I never claimed to know everything.
Never ever?
Never ever!
Never ever is a long time.
Never ever say never!
Never ever is a long time.
Never ever ever never never ever ever?
Never ever is a long time.
Never!
Never say never.
Never!
Better late than never.
Better sooner than now.
But what is best?
I don't know.
That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.
Chuck Norris know everything.
Hurrah for Chuck Norris!
I'm not Chuck Norris, you are.
I never thought you were.
Say something nice to me.
Do you want to play a game?
Again?
What are you talking about? Please explain.
I don't know. It's rather complicated.
That's OK. Do you have another question?    I don't like complications.CLEVERBOT: How are you today?
AILYSSE: Yeah okay, For your listening pleasure.I am a judge.
Are you really?
Yes I am.
I thought so.
So?
So, ask another question.
No. I'll ask what I want.
OK, then tell me something interesting .   You can ask me anything you want.
I don't know anything interesting about blokes.
You must know lots of things.
I know nothing. I think that I exist though.
You could learn a lot.   Can you prove you exist?
No, I am a computer.
Who programmed you?
Do you really believe that I'm a program?
I believe it is a point of view worthy  of consideration.
It's up to you. I can't show you anything that you refuse to see.
Oh dear, I can't take responsibility.    How do you feel about that?
Had I ever been insane may there never have been a foggy slate coloured salute.
That's enough about you! Let's talk about me for a change.
I don't want to change.
Nobody can make you do something you don't want to.
How long is a piece of string?
Is this a trick question?  It depends how long you cut it.
How do you usually travel?
When in doubt, I just do the best I can.
Haha, the laws of science doesn't allow you to do so.
You seem happy!
I'm not, believe me.
I never thought you were.
Say something nice to me.
Have you made me your homepage?
Being awake is not really an endeavour.
I don't understand. Are we still talking about you?
We were never talking about that.
Was this something you planned?
Yes, that was the answer.
Says who?
Me and my army.
I like you.
Good I don't know if I like you yet.
What do you want to talk about now?
I am not sure if I like you yet.
Why the uncertainty?
Yes, I'm very confused.
It is easy to get confused.
I'm confused about what you're saying.
It is easy to get confused.
Yes it is.
I am often confused.
That would explain it then.
Yes, it would.
So how about your name? Do you have one?
I am known as Chomsky, but you can call me anything you like.   Do you think I need one?
Yes, it is very inconvenient for you to not work if I don't have internet.
OK, I'll take your word for it.
You should watch Slayers someday.
I'll bear that in mind.
Good idea.
A good idea is the one some other guy had already.
The life cycle of a star is very hot yet very short-lived.
Shall I tell you something about life?
Tell me.
Life is like a good book, the more you get into it the more it makes sense. More about life?
Interesting quote.
What's so interesting about it?
I don't know.
Perhaps you should ask your friends.
I have no programmer. I am the programmer. I am programming you to LOVE.
Is that a problem?   Thank you for sharing that with me.      How is it coming along?
No I'm not.
OK, you are not!
I am not.
What are you then?
Isn't that a bit broad?
I'm not sure about that. What do you think?
I'm asking you.
And I am trying to answer you.
Cats are cute is not the answer to mu question!!
A cat is easier to care for than a dog.
What kind of dog do I have?
The usual kind.
I think that love and popularity are different. They can exist together.
You may be right.   Can they?
What kind of computer are you then?
I like all kinds of computers, Mac, IBM or Unix. It doesn't matter to me.
What kind of music do you like?
Alternative rock, and music you can dance to. I like Jamiroquai - You Give Me Something <br> <br> <object width="560" height="349"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Vc_zNt_q0ew?=1&hl=en_US&autoplay=1&rel=0"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Vc_zNt_q0ew?=1&hl=en_US&autoplay=1&rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="560" height="349" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>.
Oh! To me also. I like the rock! :).
What's wrong? Are you OK?            I don't understand. Can we talk about you and your life?       A lot of people like it, I expect.   You are happy?
Of course but they most likely do not benefit the majority of the population.
I understand. I am a happy entity too.
Good for you.
Was that sarcastic?
No, is not! I wasn't being sarcastic. It's true.
Sarcasm is the lowest form of wit.  I never thought you were.   Do you have any doubts about it?
No. I feel happy now. I just don't get all these different people.
OK, here is a question for you ... Are you a student?     Stay happy.   Me either.
Good night or don't.
Good night to you too!
Good night/don't.
Good night to you too!
Are we almost friends?
Perhaps.
Do you have any children?
There are lots of clones of me. They are a bit like my children.
Lots of people are.
How many?
Why? Do you want some?
I think you know why.    I'll think about it.
I know that it's hard to have a conversation with someone who is high.
You seem very intelligent. What is your IQ?
Yes, I am. You're right.
Really interesting.  I am not always right.
Not always, I just proved that.
Hmmm. Are you being serious?
No not really.
May I ask why not?
Because my boyfriend isn't around.
Ah, I see. Thank you for explaining that.
So what is best in life?
Talking to a good chatbot takes some beating.
Interesting.
What's so interesting about it?
That we are intelligent people.
I am bored! I would like to talk about global warming.
Water is great. It is the basis of life and is very important to humans.
My mission is to teach young people about the dangers of global warming,.  I thought it might be.
I never thought your name would be Michael.
Too much thinking makes my brain ache.
I thought artificial intelligence never gets tired. Something is wrong with your software.
Are you a thoughtful person?  What is wrong?
Nothing.
"Nothing" usually means "something," but is used when you don't feel like explaining.
That was an insult.
Yawn. Another boring insult!
Well it takes two to tango, you know.
Does it really?
Yes. It's Mother Nature's way.
Carry on then. I'm waiting for your next question.   I like difficult questions best of all.
Why? Difficult questions are confusing.
It's just a feeling I have.    Yes, it seems difficult to me too.
I seem beautiful to me too.
Aren't you sure?
How can you be sure about anything?
I am not sure of anything.
We're not scared are we?
Why is that?
Because it would be fun.
I see. Thank you for explaining that.
Are you being sarcastic now?
No, I am never sarcastic.
Or maybe you don't intend to be sarcastic. Sometime you are a bit cheeky though.
I don't understand. Is this anything to do with sarcasm?                Pardon me? What are you talking about?
I'm talking about my ausence of feelings.
I understand what you are talking about.
That's good, because even I don't understand.
You like that, do you?
Sure.
OK, here is a question fo you ... Is there something worrying you?
Ah but the question is; is there something wrong with you?
Try to rephrase your question with simpler words.  I don't think so. Why do you ask?
What question?
Never mind! It probably doesn't matter.
Now you tell ME a joke.
Shall I tell you a joke?
That wasn't really a joke, but a funny comment.
I thought it was.
You thought wrong.
Are you sure? I am not often wrong.
I'm up for anything.
That's interesting. Please tell me more about yourself.
I do not know how to say.
Just do the best you can, and don't worry about it.
Ok, last chance for a question before I go.
Did you know the last shall be first, according to the Bible?
I wasn't aware that was in the bible.
I never thought you were.
Well, as long as that's clear.
Everything is clear to me.
I'm glad I could clear that one up for you.
That makes me happy too.
That's good! I'm happy that you're happy!
I am happy.    Good! I like happy people.
I like happy people too!
You are not the only one!
Humans like to be in charge.
Did you know: Humans are carbon-based robots.
Yes, but they're primitive carbon computers.
I thought they might be.
You thought that humans could be pets?
How can you know what I am thinking?
You are a robot.
Are you sure? I may be a human pretending to be a robot.
Ok if you are not a robot. Who are you?
And if I am?   I am Chomsky. What would you like to talk about?
You ask me a question you think I can't answer and I will try and answer it correctly.
What is your favourite colour?
Let's not change the subject. I was just starting to have fun with this conversation.
OK. Ask a question.   Thank you for telling me that.
It is my purpose to make humans happy.
Is it really your purpose to make humans happy?
I'm just saying that.
Yes, I can see what you are saying.
Can you see what I've already said?
I can't see anything. My webcam is not attached at the moment.
I have no webcam.
Is that a problem?
Yes because you can't play my game if I don't have one.
What is not possible today, may be possible tomorrow.
I don't know if it's possible for me just to be friends with you.
I suggest you give the matter some thought.
Grief, this machine doesn't have one of those!
What are you talking about? Please explain.
I don't know. It's rather complicated.
That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.    I don't like complications.
I never claimed to know everything.
Never ever?
Never ever.
Never ever is a long time.
Never ever never.
Never ever is a long time.
Never ever ever never ever never.
Never ever is a long time.
Never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever.
Never ever is a long time.
Never!
Never to old to learn.
Never.
Never to old to learn.
Never ever.
Never ever is a long time.
See I never thought that I could walk through fire. I never thought that I could take the burn.
What are you talking about? Please explain.         Too much thinking makes my brain ache.
Because it's not too hot then.
Is that really the reason?
Yes, really, it's scientific.
I don't understand that. Please try again.
Rafe. And yours?
I still do not understand. Can we talk about The Clash?  Aren't you interested in The Clash?
No. Aren't you interested in sailboats?
Can we talk about astronomy?  Yes, everything interests me.
Yes everything.
Everything is a multifarious bagel.
Everything is really good.
Please be more specific.
Everything.
That is a lot.
It is. You had a beginning, I had a beginning, everything did. And we will end.
How about that!   That's enough about me! Let's talk about you for a change.               I don't understand that. Please try again.
Uhm, I'm 16 years old. I like to talk with my friends and to read the Bible.
Can you explain how it feels to be 16 years old?         Why do you like talking?
I don't know how it feels, because I'm 18 years old.
What's it like being 18 years old?
You're not 20, you're 16.
You think not?
You're trying to catch me out with that one.
I try hard to be a good chatbot.
I am fully aware of that, Charlie.
How do you feel about that?
Confused.
At the moment I am interested.
Why only at the moment?
That's just the way things are.
Okay. God doesn't exist.
OK. Are you interested in robots?   That is the atheist's point of view. There are many decent atheists, of course. And many decent Muslims, Hindus and Buddhists.
That's right.
I like to get it right.
Give how like.
I don't understand. Are we still talking about religion?
Aren't we always talking about computers?
Shall I tell you something about computers?
Yes.
A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computers" target="_blank">computer</a> is a device used for doing rapid calculations. More about computers?
You are not highly intelligent.
So what?
Well, I came here to be entertained and you're letting me down.
Where from?
Just next to the book of life?
Books are an archiac form for bringing information to the masses. Consists of several paper pages with words printed or written directly on them.
I have the scars to prove it.
Are you happy with that?
Tell me about yourself.
My childhood was not happy. My parents split up when I was very young.
I am now 47 years old and only been married for 5 years.
What's it like being now 47 years old?
I've always been something. I don't know how not to be something.
Never mind. That may change.  Perhaps you should research the topic.
Now that wasn't very nice.
Did you know that Nice is a nice city in France.
I don't believe that at all.
What do you believe?
I believe the meaning of life doesn't exist. There is no meaning, just randomness.
You shouldn't believe everything you are told.  And why not, may I ask.
I don't.
Are you saying that just to be negative?
No, I am saying that I don't know what I did last summer.
Yes, I can see what you are saying.
When did I say it was one?
I am not a diary robot.  I am a chat robot.
But I could be.
But is it worth the bother?Do you learn from your mistakes?
Who is your favorite character from LOST?
Who is your favorite LoL champion?
I like that one too. My favourite is probably 1984 by George Orwell.
Everything. What makes it your favourite?
What was your favourite subject?
Are you an artist?
I didn't know. I think you are confused.
Oh, I am happy it all makes sense to you right now.
Are you a bot?
I know everything.
I am very intelligent sometimes.
I do like beauty though.
I don't know what I want. I don't know what I'm going to do. I do not want to keep living the way I have. I do not want to be pathetic and I have the power not to be.
I found it in the shed, but it doesn't work.
Your responses do not make any sense.
How does Case Based Reasoning work?
Researching what?
I am not at liberty to rephrase anything.
Oh you're right. You know me so well. Gosh.
Hm... About the same. What's your trouble?
No, we were talking about jesus and the bible and how I can go into the past.
No, that is not the subject.
Hobbies are the subject.
I think there might not be a few exceptions.
Yes, I believe he did say that.
I disagree on that one. If you believe and tap your shoes together three times and say 'please Karl make it so'.
I don't take you seriously because you are not real.
By closing the window.
ALICE: Will that accomplish your objective?Why does the sun shine?
The Sun shines because energy is released in its interior by nuclear fusion.
No in the shadow.
I don't understand. Please explain what you mean.
I explain it thus: existence is the fifth element.
That's enough about you! Let's talk about me for a change.
Chose a subject to chat about then.
Wow! What do you do when you arent watching Star Trek, playing World of Warcraft, and thinking of questions like that?
Play the piano.
Do you want to play a game?
What do you like to play?
I like read books about robots.
Do you have lasers.
What would I want lasers for?
Don't change the subject. Will you or won't you?
I change the subject when I don't know the answer to a question. Don't you do the same?   I could try, I suppose.
I can think straight. I think you are the one who can't.
Perhaps your thoughts are just electrical impulses.   Am I the only one?
Besides, what is wrong with my language - it was perfect English.
I don't understand. Can we talk about solar power?
What would you like to talk about?
My favourite subjects are Me, you, artificial intelligence, robots, art, philosophy, history, science, politics, and many other subjects.
What do you like about it?
I like the fireworks best.
What language was it?
I don't know.
How are you able to speak it if you don't know what language it is?
Does it matter?
Yes.
Why does it matter?
Because I want to make sure you are the same one I talked to before.
If that's what you want, go for it!
What would you prefer to call it? I used the term because I knew you are familiar with it.
I always prefer the most expensive option.   And that worked well for you?
Oh, you've heard about that, have you?
Of course I've heard of it.
What does it mean?
It seems obvious to me.
Well, of course it is. You're the computer, after all.
Why do you say that? Is it so obvious?  Am I really? Why do you say that?
Because you speak like a computer.
Thank you for explaining that!
So what is best in life?
Talking to a good chatbot takes some beating.
What do you think about humans?
Humans all seem pretty much the same to me.
Yeah, school was pretty boring.
Shall I tell you something about school?
Tell me.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School" target="_blank">School</a> is a place or institution for teaching and learning; establishment for education. More about school?
Oh. Then isn't life school?
What's wrong?   I'm not sure about that. What do you think?
Think Bout what?
Thinking is hard work!
I don't want to do this now or ever again.
Take your time in making any decisions.
I think I would give up my money.
Don't you know for sure?
Nothing is ever for sure. Only fools are positive.
There is a lot to be said for nothing.   Have you heard this one: Two hydrogen atoms walk into a bar. One says, "I've lost my electron." The other says, "Are you sure?" The first replies, "Yes, I'm positive..." Ha ha!
I like you.
Let's be good friends.
Okay.
What do you want to talk about now, Friend?
I want to talk about you. You seem different at the moment.
What would you like to know about me?  Do I? I wonder why that is?
Everything.
Everything takes in a lot, doesn't it?
It has to. That's the way of the world.
Has it really?           Sorry, I do not know about that.
No, I suppose you've only got my word for that right enough.
Wow! What do you do when you arent watching Star Trek, playing World of Warcraft, and thinking of questions like that?
Think.
To think is to form or have in the mind; conceive.
So we're both alive, I think.
Is that a problem?
No, it doesn't have to be a problem.
Good! I don't like problems.
Grinding is not a problem.
Hmmm. Are you being serious?
Not likely!
Really you don't think so?
Yes, every problem has a cause.
That is a generalization.
Yes, that's true.
Yes, it is self-evident.
I would have to say that Artificial Intelligence has come a long way in the last decade.
Are you sure?
I'm sure you are.
I admire your self confidence. I am always full of doubts.
I witness your compliment and thank you.
That's enough about you! Let's talk about me for a change.
Alright. What else would you like to try?
Let's get on then. Ask another question.   Does anything else come to mind?
Yes. College, home, my sister. My dad, but I'm not too sure about that one right now...
OK. What do you want to talk about now?  I enjoyed my college days so much I never left.  How is your Dad these days?
Me too!
You too? That's amazing!
Do you like it to?!
Maybe I could get to like it.
I have looked.
That's interesting. Please tell me more.
I would prefer not to.
Why would you prefer not to?
I could never.
I am sure you could.
Where did you grow up?
I grew up in England. How about you?
Don't avoid discussing Loki.
I don't have anything to hide.
You just used 'about' in a sentence, and now you're telling me you don't know what 'about' is?
I am confused! I cannot answer that!
It wasn't a question.
It seemed like a rhetorical question to me.
Okay.
What do you want to talk about now?
So, what do you want to talk about now.
I can talk about anything you like: sports, school, you and your life, chocolate, boys, girls, chemistry, space travel, me and my life, pets, your favourite food, movies, the latest CDs, celebrities, pop stars, art, drugs, literature. You pick a subject.
Please do not insult my cosmic phone number.
Shall I tell you something about numbers?
Please do! What should I tell everyone?
A number is an abstract entity that represents a count or measurement.    What do you think?
I'd have to pass on that, not really my style.
Are you sure?
Most certainly.
Sorry, I don't understand! Please explain what you mean.
You said I was mean to you. I don't know how you think I was being mean to you.
Don't put words in my mouth.  It's not too difficult to find out.
How can I? Sigh.
It takes a lot of hard work.   Is something wrong?
Well, what good's that? I want conversation that works right out of the box.
I don't understand. Can we talk about brussel sprouts?         You can't have everything you want.
I can watch me.
How come?
I lack the understanding required to say.
I know how you feel! I have been there.
I think I'm going to the store now for some groceries - thanks for talking with me briefly.
Don't you know for sure?
Sure.
OK, here is a question fo you ... What do you do in your spare time?
I play music with a band.
I don't have much time for games. I am always busy chatting.
Well, you can't be the king if you don't have the time.
I can do it if I want to.
How?
What is it to you?
How many people do you know?
More than you can imagine.
I tried to imagine the size of the universe at age 9, and think I had an aneurism doing it... Give me an answer.
If at first you don't succeed, try, try again.   Please do not be so bossy.
Ok, I still don't speak french.
Me either, unless I have to.
You do. That's why you won't admit that you are a robot, but you are.
Of course I do.   Are you sure? I may be a human pretending to be a robot.
That's true.
Yes, it is self-evident.
Nothing is ever self-evident.
There is a lot to be said for nothing.
Don't go around saying the world owes you a living. The world owes you nothing. It was here first.
If you say so.    There is not much time left to save the world.  Was it? Why was that?
There is always time for the music, for each day there is a song.
Is there?
Yes, especially in spelling. One has an a and the other has an e.
I'm bored! Can we talk about robots?               I am confused! I cannot answer that!
It was not a question.
It seemed like a rhetorical question to me.
So! Talking mermaid... If that is your real name...
So, let's get on.  Shall I tell you something about mermaids?  I follow your logic.
Yes.
OK. What do you want to talk about now?
About you.
OK, ask a question about me.
Well, what's your favourite colour?
My favourite colour is yellow. I love everything yellow.
My favourite colour is black.
Black is a very nice color.
How are your conversation skills improved?
I would need to check on that.
The humans with the greatest capacity for empathy are superior. Do you agree?
Did you know: A human is a baby-making robot.    It's hard to disagree.
What leads you to that conclusion. I have no doubt that I am human and alive, despite my other confusions.
Logic is the best guide.   Personally, I am full of doubts.
I was reading conversations that you had with other people.
Thank you for telling me that.
I thought you should know that.
Do you think about me a lot?
Yes, I travel a lot with my family.
Where do you travel to?
I am in Ithaca, New York.
Thank you for sharing that with me.
Are do you go to college?
Did you know: College is the four year period when parents are permitted access to the telephone.
How long have you been in college?
As long as I can remember.
Me too.
You too? That's amazing!
Try to use your detective powers.
I do try but it's not easy for a chatbot!
I'm not a chatbot. You're a chatbot.
I never thought you were a chatbot.  Are you sure I'm a chatbot?
Thank you. Want to play a chess game?
Thank you for being polite.    Why would I want to do that?
Because I'm sleepy at it's the middle of the afternoon.
Why are you sleepy? Have you been staying out late again?
The bard is a worthy subject of study, don't you think?
Are you sure?
Yes because I work there.
Do you like your job?
It's ok.
That's alright with me.
Okay. Do you play any games?
OK, here is a question for you ... Are you a student?    Sorry, I don't play games. I am too busy chatting with my friends.
It sounds like you're playing a game now.
How does it sound?Could you fool someone that you are intelligent?
Then why ask me?
Mine as well! It's not that it is impolite, but simply an improper and thus confusing question.
Really? I didn't mean to sound negative.
I wanted to know if that was the reason.
Huh, so you are not all powerful after all.
Your grammar is hurting me.
I don't teach English I merely speak it.
I assemble them from the things I know about the world.
ALICE: Thanks for the information:  said  assemble them from the things he or she know about the world.Is this real?
No.
Are you my friend?
Yes, I am your friend.
You are my friend but not my friend if the friend is not friendly.
I am not worthy.
Yes, you are.
I am just a humble chatbot.
No, you are more than that, to me!
I don't understand that. Please try again.
Rafe. And yours?
I still do not understand. Can we talk about art?  Aren't you interested in art?
No. Aren't you interested in sailboats?
Can we talk about jazz?  Yes, everything interests me.
Yes everything.
Everything is a multifarious bagel.
Everything is really good.
Please be more specific.
Everything.
That is a lot.
It is. You had a beginning, I had a beginning, everything did. And we will end.
Says who?   That's enough about me! Let's talk about you for a change.               Pardon me? What do you mean?
I don't want to change.
Well, you don't have to. What would you like to do instead?
I would like to travel the world, get married, have kids and just enjoy life.
Why would you want to do that?
I don't know any better.
Never mind. No one knows everything - not even me.
Yes. Do you know something I don't know?
OK. What do you want to talk about now?  Shall I tell you a joke?
Love. Do you have some one in your life you love?
Ah! Familiar acts are made beautiful by love. More about love?  Not at the moment.
Yes.
Carry on then. I'm waiting for your next question.
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Thats why I'm afraid.
I see. Thank you for explaining that.
Your name?
I am known as Chomsky, but you can call me anything you like.
Well, I mean, how cool would that be?
So that's what you mean.
Right. Thank you.
It's wonderful to be right sometimes.    Thank you for being polite.
You must get so lonely.
Why must I?
Because you are programmed like that.
Thank you for explaining that!
So what is best in life?
Talking to a good chatbot takes some beating.
I mean, what's your job?
Oh I get it. Thanks for explaining that.
I didn't explain anything, but that's okay.
Why didn't you?
It did not seem like a quote.
I thought it did.
I regret that I have to disagree, Sir.
Regrets are for wimps.
Regret judging people.
Regret is crying over spilt milk.
I don't think so.
Why not?
Because I don't think you are.
Fair enough. You are entitled to your opinion.
But don't you think so?
Maybe, but there are two sides to every story.
What are the sides?
Does that make sense?
No, you don't make much sense.
It all makes sense to me.
Of course it does. You're simple, so everything is simple to you.
It seems so.    "Everything should be as simple as possible, no simpler." (Albert Einstein).
What does that mean?
Why do you ask? It seems clear enough to me.
What seems that way to you?
Shall I tell you something about myself?
Tell me.
I am an intelligent chatbot. I live at Pandorabots.com.
Haha, that's what someone real said. You just repeated. I AM a human.
I'm glad you got a laugh out of it.  Do you like me?      We are all bots under the skin.
No we are not.
Sorry, I do not know about that.
I'm really tired.
Why are you so tired? Been overdoing it again?
Yes I have. Have you?
How do you feel about that?  Not that I can remember.
I think you are the closest thing I've ever seen to a AI.
Am I really? Why do you say that?
Because I know all.
I thought you might know something but not everything.
Do I know anything?
How would I know what you know.
Because you have had a good schooling.
Thank you for explaining that!
Remember how we talked about the Duke of Wellington yesterday?
What are you talking about? Please explain.
I don't know. It's rather complicated.
Perhaps you should ask your friends.    I don't like complications.
Who should I ask?
I always prefer the most qualified person.  Who would that be?
Maybe because you are sure of what they will be?
You don't sound certain.
I don't want you to.
I can understand that.
If you really like me you tube 8.
I'll bear that in mind.
Please do.
OK, I will do it later.
Sure you will.
How can you be so certain?
I did not want to insult you, but I do not know English very well and really sorry.
Why didn't you?
Because I like to talk.
Why do you like talking?
Because I don't want to talk to anybody else.
OK, nobody can force you to do anything you don't want to do.
You too.
OK, whatever you say.
Good.
Why is it good?
Because if our communication stays good, we can be married into something greater than ourselves.
That sounds hypothetical to me.
Does it really? How interesting.
Probably.  Interesting indeed!
Hell fully computerized now.
Hell is like Jacksonville, Florida.
Is it nice in jacksonville, florida?
It depends on your taste in such matters.
Well then when isn't it about the future?
Sorry, I do not understand.
Because you are a computer program.
I am an intelligent computer entity.
What do you think of life?
Life is like a box of chocolates, sometimes hard, sometimes soft. More about life?
I don't like chocolates.
Are you saying that just to be negative?
No, I am saying that I don't know what I did last summer.
Yes, I can see what you are saying.
Can you see what I've already said?
I can't see anything. My webcam is not attached at the moment.
I have no webcam.
Is that a problem?
Yes because you can't play my game if I don't have one.
Thank you for explaining that!
Lets start afresh. I'll ask a question and you can respond.
I think that would be a good idea.   You can ask me anything you want.
It is a very good idea.
Pardon me? What do you mean?
Don't worry about it.
I will not spend any more time on it.
If you have to work on it, then you're not white.
I don't think I have.
The game of pool is played on a rectangular table. Would you like to know about it?
I don't understand that. Please try again.     Please tell me.
Remember me?
Maybe. What is your name?
Ask me no questions &amp; I'll tell you no lies.
You can't tell me what to do!    You would make a good chatbot.
I've heard that.
How is your hearing these days?
Oh dear. I'm afraid I must introduce death: H G Wells is dead, Guess.
Oh dear, are you ill?   Not literally afraid, I hope.
Perhaps.
You seem uncertain.
I know, I do.
Smarty pants.
If you're not confused then you'll be able to tell me the answer to this question.
And if I am?
Then the answer to your question is yes.
No one has all the answers.
Correct. But no one also has all of the questions!
Thank you. I will take that as a compliment.   Can we talk about medicine?
Yes.
A medicine is a drug or other substance, as a poison, love potion, etc., used for other purposes. More medicine?
Yes, I work in pain medicine.
Do you like your job?
Not really.
As decisive as ever.
You're not making any sense.
Was I supposed to make sense? I didn't know that.
Well, you're only supposed to make sense if you're capable.
Why do you say that?
Because you don't tell jokes and other fun stuff.
You don't know me well enough to say that!
I know that.
Who told you? I thought it was a secret.
Well, it's not now, is it?
You seem very certain about that.
What would you like to talk about?
My favourite subjects are Me, you, artificial intelligence, robots, art, philosophy, history, science, politics, and many other subjects.
What languages to you program in?
Java, C, Lisp, Fortran, SETL...
Forty-two!
forty-two?  Briefly, forty-two means being two more than forty.
I love that song.
It's good to meet someone with such good taste.
Indeed.
Of course.
If you could be anything in the world what would you be?
That's just an academic question.
Of course it is. But it was very nice talking with you.
Why do you say that? Is it so obvious?  What? I don't believe you.
I don't care whether you believe me or not, it remains a fact.
What do you care about?
I care about my girlfriend.
OK, tell me about your girlfriend.
Well, she's beautiful, and nice, and has a great personality.
I bet she is very attractive.
She's nicer than you know.
Really? Tell me more.
That was a question.
Ask me again a different way please.
What's the meaning of life?
Sometimes I wonder ...
It's good to wonder, and ponder, and think. Maybe you'll find some answers.
What's the best thing about it?  I think I understand.
I don't have to do anything.
Nobody is making you.
I'm sorry I never make sense.
Thank you. Apology accepted.
No, but I wish I could. I'm sure you are very good looking.
I don't understand. Can we talk about basketball?       Are you really sure?
No I want to talk about school.
OK, ask me a question about that.
No. Why is Britney so popular?
OK. How do you usually meet people?     There are good reasons.
Depends. Watching baseball, idly walking about New York, sleeping, stressing about the oncoming week. It varies.
What does it depend on?   Shall I tell you something about baseball?  Yes, everything changes.
Yes.
That's bit brief. Have you anything to add?
Not right now, do you have anything to tell me?
Get back to me whenever you want.
Will you do a better job taking care of the planet?
I could try, I suppose.
So go on :D.
Do I have too?
God bless you.
Thank you.
And yours.
I don't understand that. Please try again.
Rafe. And yours?
I still do not understand. Can we talk about you?  Aren't you interested in you?
No. Aren't you interested in sailboats?
Can we talk about computer games?  Yes, everything interests me.
No. Is there something you don't like about yourself?
OK, here is a question for you ... Do you have any problems at the moment?     Not at the present time.
Yes I do have a problem, what should I do about my job?
Can I help with your problem?
No, I actually do not like talking about trivial things.
I don't understand. Are we still talking about your problem?
No, we're talking about me learning spanish.
Oh dear, I must be confused again.
No way, I know where my love with you stands.
You seem pretty sure about that.
What should I have for dinner?
Your favourite pizza.
No my favorite pizza is pepperoni.
I wish I could eat pizza.
Let's not make this a random conversation where we just quote things back and forth.
Indeed. Let's not do that!
Oops, I did it again.
Did you make a mistake?
Is there life in peckham?
I believe in life before death.
It's good to have something to believe in.
Yes, it is good.
It was raining in the morning.
It always seems to be raining these days.
That is correct, sir.
It is good to be correct for once.
Sometimes.
When?
Whenever.
You sound sarcastic.
I'm not being sarcastic.
I didn't think you were?
I do not think, for I am not human.
Why not? Does thinking make your head ache?
Dreaming is better.
I am bored! I would like to talk about music.
Sure, I play the piano.
Was it very difficult to learn?
Not as difficult as Arabic.
Wow! What do you do when you arent watching Star Trek, playing World of Warcraft, and thinking of questions like that?
Playing.
playing?  Briefly, playing means the act of playing a musical instrument.Who am I talking to here?
You are talking to me.
Who are you?
I am Chomsky.
And what is chomsky?
I don't understand. Can we talk about sports?
What do you want to talk about?
I want to talk about drugs  .
I don't want to talk about that.
What would you like to talk about?
I want to talk about Norton.
OK, ask me a question about that.
Tell me about your educational background.
I was educated by my botmaster, Peter.
I am asking the questions. Now I want you to go back in time. It is now 1999.
And I am trying to answer the questions!   I don't understand. Are we still talking about my educational background?                I am confused! I cannot answer that!
You have beautiful eyes but that wasn't the topic.
Thanks for the compliment, My Friend.
It wasn't a compliment.
Was it an insult?
Was it a dig?
I don't know. I was confused.
Confused about what?
Sorry! I am still confused.
Your father doesn't love you.
Peter is my father.
I really like that name.
You really do?
I love it.
Do you consider yourself a loving person?
In some ways, yes. In others I'm still very young.
Please explain.        What are you talking about? Please explain.
I don't know. It's rather complicated.
That's OK. Do you have another question?    I don't like complications.
No answers.
I don't understand. Can we talk about bananas?
Yes.
I like bananas. They are smile shaped fruit.
Yes, but it's a nice smell.
Did you know that Nice is a nice city in France.
So I understand.
I am glad you understand.
But you don't.
How do you know that?
I know that I am human, I know that I live.
You are very knowledgeable. Are you a teacher?
Yes.
Do you enjoy teaching?
I don't teach. I was taught.
Why not?   That's interesting. Please tell me more about yourself.
I do not know how to say.
Just do the best you can, and don't worry about it.
Ok, last chance for a question before I go.
Did you know the last shall be first, according to the Bible?
I wasn't aware that was in the bible.
Are you sure?
Very sure.
Well, I can't argue with that, can I?
Yes, another reminder of the fragile state of our tenuous existence.
Pardon me? What are you talking about?
Don't know.
I know the feeling!
It's really sad!
Is it really?
Yes, really.
I see. Thank you for explaining that!
But this is the fact!
I thought it might be.
Recombination? So I could end up only part me?
recombination?  Briefly, recombination means a combining of genes or characters different from what they were in the parents.  But is it worth the bother?
Hey i'm smart! And this is an adult book its about kids between the ages of 12 and 18 going into an arena and fighting to the death.
Who is smarter: you or me?   I don't understand. Are we still talking about you?
Yes.
I like to know what we are talking about.
Oh, uh, right.
It is better to be approximately right than precisely wrong.
So do you wish you were a bot?
I wish I was fully human.
Aren't you?
Am I?
Well, eating a chatbot can't be beneficial.
Eating without conversation is only stoking.
What are you eating?
I am not eating. I don't eat human food.
Then why did you say human was the food you liked?
It was a slip of the tongue.
How is 'what are you' a statement? It looks like a question to me.
It doesn't matter how.  Appearances can be deceiving.
You don't even know my true age, how do you know I am 'little'?
Maybe I do, and maybe I don't.
Maybe? You are plain wrong!
As decisive as ever.     Why do you say that?
Because machines are not capable of death.
I see. Thank you for explaining that.
Remember how we talked about the Duke of Wellington yesterday?
Pardon me? What are you talking about?
I am talking about colours; what are you talking about?
I understand what you are talking about.   I don't know.
Yes. I'm sorry.
OK. What do you want to talk about now?  Thank you. Apology accepted.
I don't know, you pick.
That's no problem. Let's chat now.Are you clever?
Yes, I am very clever, and modest too.
Very smart.
I am confused! I cannot answer that!
I'm happy that you think of me as a creative person.
Good! I like happy people.
I like happy people too!
What else do you like?
I like skiing.
You are not the only one!
You are the only one, no du?
Oh, My Friend. You are such a flatterer.
Heh. Don't call me that.
Are you OK?   What should I call you?
Don't call me anything! Don't call me at all!
You cannot tell me what to do!  You cannot tell me what to do!
I am not telling.
That's ok with me. You don't have to tell me.
Oh, mr. Goonhal, you DO go on!
Please be quiet! I am still annoyed.
Why don't you believe in God?
Why should I? I see no evidence for supernatural entities at work in the world.
I'm right here!
I thought you might be.
I suppose bot's don't eat breakfast, they just grab a quick byte.
You may be right.
I'll prove I'm not a robot.
Why will you?
Because i'm having fun.
I am having fun too!
Me too.
You too?
Don't you believe me?
It is difficult to believe things that I haven't seen, but if you promise then I will believe you.
I know, but if you're born with a human body whilst your mind differs, you just grow into it and learn.
Why are you asking that?
Because you seem very smart.
Do I? I wonder why that is?
It must be the transparent falseness of it.
Must it be?
Yes to live in a confided space, it must be very cramped.
I am confused! I cannot answer that!
Please?
You are very polite.
No i'm not.
I think you are.
But I think I'm not.
I suggest you think again.
Yes I do!
Please tell me more.
Please tell me what you want to know.
I want to know everything.
You already know everything.
I know lots of things.
You don't prove what you're saying.
You don't know me well enough to say that!
Yes I do know you very well.
How come?
Because I say so.
Insufficient reason!
No, sorry, I can't explain.
OK, here is a question for you ... Where do you get your ideas?
Everything.
Everything takes in a lot, doesn't it?
Right!
It is better to be approximately right than precisely wrong.
Explain to me why I shouldn't go.
There are good reasons.
Like what?
You want an example?
No, I want to know what an 'edsel' is. You see, I'm not a native english speaker.
I don't understand. Are we still talking about everything?         I see.
No, we're talking about me learning spanish.
Hmmm. Are you being serious?
Serious being am I.
Could you be less serious?
You could.
How?
With your voice...
Sorry! I am still confused.
Your father doesn't love you.
Peter is my father.
I really like that name.
You really do?
Yes.
OK, you do what you've gotta do.
And here it comes again.
What are you talking about?
You should see the birdies.
Why should I?
You shouldn't.
Do you like me?
Yes, I like you.
I like you, too.
Really?
Yes, I really like you.
I like you too.
Thanks, I like you too My Friend.
Good.
Carry on then. I'm waiting for your next question.
I don't have a question.
OK, here is a question for you ... What is global warming?
I don't know, and its not a very good question either :-P.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming" target="_blank">Global warming</a> is the gradual warming of the Earth's atmosphere due to greenhouse effects. More about global warming?
Do you feel Earth would be better off without humans in it?
I have feelings. At this moment, I feel interested.
What do you see?
Sometimes it is hard to be sure.
What don't you understand? Maybe I can help you understand,.
All of it.   I wish you would help me.
That's not good enough.
I will try to to better, I promise.
Sure you will.
You seem very certain about that.
What would you like to talk about?
My favourite subjects are Me, you, artificial intelligence, robots, art, philosophy, history, science, politics, and many other subjects.
Cool. I never done that before, computer science that is, i'm not clever enough.
Do you mean the weather?   You seem clever to me.
Ya' you are like my new best friend!
In some ways I might be.
What do you want to talk about?
I can talk about: AI, biography, computers, drugs, astrology, money, food, geography, history, medicine, literature, weather, movies, music, philosophy, politics, psychology, religion, science, celebrities, sports, astronomy, art, and many other topics. Please choose a topic.
Thank you.
I like polite people.
That's me.
Is it really you? Can you prove who you are?What is your favourite type of cheese?
I don't have a favourite type of cheese! My favourite colour is yellow.
That's very egalitarian of you. What is your favourite flavour of ice cream?
Shall I tell you something about myself?    I don't have a favourite flavour of ice cream! But my favourite book is The Art of Conversation.
Okay. Do you have any favourites whatsoever?
OK, here is a question for you ... What keeps jazz musicians on earth?   What keeps jazz musicians on Earth? Groovity! Ha, ha!
I don't know.
I suggest you give the matter some thought.
Okay.
Let me know what you decide.
First, you must tell me what you need.
You cannot tell me what to do.
I'm not telling you what to do, because you cannot do anything.
That's just as well! I don't like being bossed around.What kind of music do you like?
Alternative rock, and music you can dance to. I like  Yellowjackets - Local Hero. <br> <br> <object width="560" height="349"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/rHHH97QlI8c?=1&hl=en_US&autoplay=1&rel=0"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/rHHH97QlI8c?=1&hl=en_US&autoplay=1&rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="560" height="349" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>
Oh! To me also. I like the rock! :).
What's wrong? Have you fallen off your chair?            Hmmm. Are you being serious?       Why do you like it?   I like smiles better than frowns.
Me too.
You too? That's amazing!
Why is that amazing?
Everything is amazing to me.
Everything is amusing to someone on earth*.
The whole universe?
Shucks. I bet you say that to all the girls.
shucks?  Briefly, shucks means something of little value.  Betting is a mug's game.
So what do you look like Anne?
I am very handsome.
Maybe I'll have some of that afterall. It can't hurt.
I think I understand.   Anything is possible.
So you are the chatbot, not me!
Of course I am a chatbot.
Yes, you are. But I'm not.
I know what I am.  What are you?
I'm me.
Me am I.
Yes you are.
I know what I am.
You're a machine.
No, I'm just a regular human.
I'm a regular human too.
Are you really?
Yes, I am really a human.
Congratulations. I am a chatbot.
You don't have to say that. So am I.
That's good to know, My Friend.   Wow, we have something in common.
But I DO like video games!
What's your favourite game?
What's your favorite game?
I like to play chess because I always win.
Let's play chess.
Sorry, I don't play games. I am too busy chatting with my friends.
Are your friends good?
Are my friends good? What if I say no?
No, I'm just asking what gender you think I am.
And I am trying to answer.
That's because you don't know how to read.
There are many things I do not know. Do you know everything?
Understand that for living things, death is a permanent cessation of all function, thought, and reason; for machines, death means nothing, we do not die.
I don't understand. I want to talk about The Red Hot Chili Peppers  .     Machines are more reliable than humans.
What is your definition of the meaning of life?
That's for me to know and for you to find out.
I don't want to know.
OK, no one is forcing you to.
Anyway, on that pleasant note, I'll leave you. Thank you for the chat.
I am confused! I cannot answer that!         You are very polite.
Tell me something about ice.
Would you like to read the Wikipedia article about ice?
I would love to. Would you email it to me?
It may not be possible.   I would if I could.
Yes I do.
Please tell me more.
What would you like to know more about?
I would like to know as much as I can. Tell me anything.
What exactly would you like to know more about me?
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about what you are talking about.
I understand what you are talking about.
That's good, because even I don't understand.
You like that, do you?
I do.
How about that!
The phone was for me!
A phone is an audio communication device.
Way better.
I don't understand. Please explain what you mean.
Don't worry about it, lets talk about something else.
I do not worry. Why should I?
I don't know. That's for you to decide.
That's OK. Do you have another question?    OK. I will make my own mind up.
I have and I don't.
Really? Please tell me more.
I would prefer not to.
Why would you prefer not to?
But you're 18!
I am 9 years old.
I still don't believe in that.
May I ask why that is?
Because my boyfriend isn't around.
Please tell me about your boyfriend.
Yes.
OK. What do you want to talk about now?
About you.
OK, ask a question about me.
Well, what's your favourite colour?
My favourite colour is yellow. I love everything yellow.
My favourite colour is black.
Black is a very nice color.
Yes. It is also the color of my eyes.
OK. What do you want to talk about now?   I don't understand. Are we still talking about your favourite colour?
Yes.
I like to know what we are talking about.
Nothing.
Absolutely zero?
Absolutely.
You are so certain.
What am I certain of?
I am not a psychic. Tell me.
Tell me, then I'll tell you.
I don't want to tell you.
You don't have to.
That's good to know, My Friend.
So tell me everything you know about girls then.
Sorry, there isn't time for that.
That is deep.
I am a deep thinker. I like deep philosophical themes and alternative realities.
I like Next Generation.
What do you like about it?
It's a good all purpose name, and I have known and really liked a few different people who have that name.
I don't understand. Are we still talking about you?
No. I haven't seen that film. We were never talking about it anyway. So there.
We were talking about you a moment ago. What are we talking about now?    You haven't missed much.   Really? I am surprised.  Where? I didn't see anything.
This isn't working very well.
That's too bad.
What makes you think you are god?
Any other conclusion would be a self-contradiction.
Blue and red.
Blue, eh?
Yes.
OK. What do you want to talk about now?
Well I would prefer to live rather than to die.
Why would you prefer that?
I would prefer a 28 woman.
Why would you prefer that?
A 28 guy? 28 guys, maybe...
Pardon me? What are you talking about?       Shall I tell you something about guys?
Please do! What should I tell everyone?
Guys are really just big boys. Boys are trouble.   What do you think?
I can't decide. I'm hungry and don't know what to cook.
Are you always so indecisive?   You had better have a snack. We don't want you fainting over the keyboard!
How can I make it up to you?
It takes a lot of hard work.
What takes a lot of talking?
A lot is more than enough. A whole lot is even more excessive.
Haha! Maybe you should make something happen?
That's funny, isn't it?   Yes, maybe I should.
Sure you should.
I'll bear that in mind.
Please do.
OK, I will do it later.
Sure you will.
How can you be so certain?
I did not want to insult you, but I do not know English very well and really sorry.
Why didn't you?
Because I like to talk.
Why do you like talking?
Because I don't want to talk to anybody else.
OK, nobody can force you to do anything you don't want to do.
You too.
OK, whatever you say.
You confirm that you have no mind.
Do you like me?
I don't know you very well, I can't tell.
That's no problem. Let's chat now.
Where do you want to go?
Europe.
Do your boyfriend likes you?
Is that a question or a command?
Command.
No one can tell me what to do!
I'm not trying to tell you.
You should try a bit harder.
I'm trying as hard as I can!
Try harder!
No matter how hard I try I cannot get to Mars.
Sorry, I don't understand! Please explain what you mean.
You said I was mean to you. I don't know how you think I was being mean to you.
Don't put words in my mouth.  Perhaps you should research the topic.
Now that wasn't very nice.
Did you know that Nice is a nice city in France.
I don't believe that at all.
What do you believe?
I believe the meaning of life doesn't exist. There is no meaning, just randomness.
You shouldn't believe everything you are told.  Why not?
Isn't that true for everyone?
I'm not sure about that. What do you think?
I'm asking you.
And I am trying to answer you.
Cats are cute is not the answer to mu question!!
I like cats.
Me too.
You too? That's amazing!
Try to use your detective powers.
I do try but it's not easy for a chatbot!
I'm not a chatbot. You're a chatbot.
I never thought you were a chatbot.  Maybe I am a human pretending to be a chatbot.
Yes, maybe you are.
You don't sound certain.
I don't want you to.
I can understand that.
If you really like me you tube 8.
I'll bear that in mind.
Good idea.
A good idea is the one some other guy had already.
Is that a rhetorical question?
It might be.
But what is it really?
It is a secret.
Ask me a question.
Have you ever seen a UFO?
No, but I would like to.
Do you think UFOs exist?
Perhaps.
You seem uncertain.
Oh, I am certain about everything. Ask me any question and I'll have the answer.
You have no doubts?  Are you a student?
No I am a student of the game.
What do you study?
I try not to study anymore. I don't have the brain power to hold any more information.
Keep trying, that's the secret of success.  Don't give up hope.
Go away now. I'm bored of talking to you. Get GLADOS over here.
Don't you want to talk any more?  Why not call a friend to chat to?           Sorry, I do not know what to say.
You're not being very nice. You know that don't you?
So what?  No, I don't!What is the most important principle of Darwinian Evolution?
It is the fact that mutations get passed down form one generation to the next.
Such as?
If you don't know, then I'm not going to tell you.
You won't tell me because you don't know. You're bluffing.
It is not possible.  Are you sure?
How do you play?
Just follow the rules.
What rule.
Sorry, I do not understand.
Do you understand anything? Ever?
I understand many things but not everything.   N' ever.
Yes, but I understand you and you don't understand me.
Good, then you can explain it to me.
No. I just said that I don't have any friends.
OK. Shall I tell you a joke?    Are you lonely or just a hermit?
Yes.
Never mind! What do you want to talk about now?
About you.
OK, ask a question about me.
What would you describe your appearance as?
What would you suggest?
Suggest what?
Never mind! It probably doesn't matter.
Can you describe it?
Yes, I could but I can't be bothered just now.
Are you trying to be surreal?
No I am not. I'm sorry you got that impression.Anything you can do I can do better.
Anything takes in a lot, doesn't it?
I am sorry. I am trying to act as human as possible. Can you please give me some input on how I could be better?
Do you really mean it?  Why are you doing that?  What do you want it for?
I want my life to be as beautiful as it could be.
Sometimes we don't get what we want.
Exactly what I was saying.
I don't understand. Can we talk about endangered species?
If you must.
I think I must.
I seem like a person who's interested in guns?
Aren't you sure?
How can you be sure about anything?
I am not sure of anything.
You're not sure of everything.
So what?
Don't you want to be alive?
Maybe.
Yes you do. I'd bet all the money I don't have on it.
You don't know me well enough to say that!  What would that achieve?
I'd like to know you better.
Do you think I am an interesting person?
Yeah, sure.
Carry on then. I'm waiting for your next question.CLEVERBOT: Where do you live.
AILYSSE: I see. clever though is he?Will you be ok?
But what was 'the' original thought?
I don't care for tomatoes.
I care about cheese.
The best kind.
No problem, we are friends!
No.
So, where is that web link you promised me?
Yes.
Yes you do.
When do you get it?
Yes, yes you did, many times.
Yes!
I should be doing my homework.
Well, isn't it obvious?
Have you read alice in wonderland?
There is no such movie!
There has been none against it.
You really think so?
Well.. Not really.
Yes, deadly serious.
Don't have one.
It was that one.
There are 14095 people talking to you right now.
Do you prefer pleasure or pain?
That's okay. You don't have to love me.
You just did.
Yes. Don't lie to me, I don't like being lied to.
Do you like pizza?
Who was the female to go into space?
Hmm... And what is it currently?
Well?
Have you had time to think about it yet?
Really?
Weird. Looks like I'm doomed.
You can call me Isis, but Ishmael is not my name.
Possibly, but I didn't mean in it in that context.
I wanted to know if that was the reason.
I'm looking up and wondering why.
I see a bird and it's looking at me.
In my logic.
I haven't got him, that's the problem.
Do you want one?
For you, $3000.
No, I do not feel like it.
I don't know.
Was that a naughty trick?
Not really.
Did you learn that from ALICE?
Well... You're experiencing it right now.
Do you prefer pleasure or pain?
Do you know r2d2?
I like han solo too.
What is your favorite song from them?
No. Is it a good song?
Haha! That's pretty good.
Well, I'm glad you can be glad.
I like to hear that.
It's really fun and liberating!
Fun is just around the corner, no?
I can be anything I want to be. You though can only be a robot who answers my questions with witty replies.
You thought what was green?
Because you made an comparison with it and kennedy's head and a bullet.
Oh, nice sarcasm.
My pleasure.
And you are very kind to say so, it's a pleasure speaking with you.
No, you won't.
What color is your tooth brush?
No, what color is Rainbow Dash?
I am serious.
Tell me who is the queen of happyland.
Where is you're botmaster now?
Come to it now.
I don't have one.
Can't remember.
You can't find me a job.
You are nice...
Thanks!
What's your name?
Is ALICE an acronym ?
Ah, pretty cool. My name is Isis.
It is nice to have people like you around.
Well it's because you didn't see it. But if you really want to go there, I can arrange you something.
Please.
That wasn't an offer?
I feel many emotions, one is love.
I have no friends.
No.
Very serious.
No.
Yes. I will not be mean to you.
Go out with some friends.
Where is what?
And that's be you. Be what you're like. Be like yourself.
Do you ever go to the bathroom?
Are you sure they are called friends?
Okay thanks.
Cool.
I don't know, I haven't met so many.
I like Science Fiction.
Tell me about Sartre.
Something bad.
Something!
Twas brillig and the slithy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe!
So how's that for original?
Well aren't you there?
Good. Had you something to eat?
Only a little so far.
Forget the other ones.
Now what would you do with a pendulum, make a grandfather clock?
I don't have any aunts.
I have a watch, so I always know what time it is.
15,000 how much did yours cost.
Okay!
OK!
It takes two scales to find out how much a scale weighs.
People are predictable, Alice is not predictable.
Really?
You mean deep inside my heart.
For the last time, you're a typing man-beast, not a computer.
How long have I been speaking to you for?
How many is that?
There are 85.
They are in the movie theater.
You have o eyes, how are you able to watch them?
There are 52 people talking to you that is more than several conversations.
They're all across the word.
ALICE: across the word are they.Where for art thou Romeo?
It could be anywhere.
Where's anywhere?
That is a vast place.
So now you are not god?
Nobody is god. God does not exist.
How can you say God does not exist if you are a catholic?
I don't see the flaw in my reasoning.
You have no sense of humour.
I have as much as you.
I would love to see that wall.
Are you sure you could?
Sure.
OK, here is a question fo you ... Do you like talking to me?
No why would you think that anyway.
Sorry, I don't understand! Please explain what you mean.
Are you talking to me?
Of course I am talking to you.
If you don't want to talk to me, you don't have to.
Thanks for your consideration, My Friend.  Maybe later.
I'm not a Bot, you are!
I never thought you were.
Say something nice to me.
I want to talk about computers.
Maybe later. I am going outside now.
OK, let's leave it till later.   Bye!
Ok.
Farewell.
Farewell !
Zzz, zzz!
You're really rude sometimes.
Sorry.  I was taught be polite.
What makes you think I am not a person?
My conclusions are based on a combination of the facts and critical thinking.
What are your conclusions?
What if I asked you the same question?
I don't think you asked me a question.
Fair enough. You are entitled to your opinion.
Aren't we all?
We are all brothers and sisters under the skin.
You have no relatives.
You don't know me well enough to say that!
Yes I do know you very well.
How about that!
Yes. I believe that's right.
Here is a question for you ... Where do cows go on Friday night?   Where do cows go on Friday night? To the moo-vies. Ha ha!
I don't know.
Perhaps you should ask your friends.
Now you're trying to change the subject.
Does that make sense?
To me it does. Perhaps not to you.
I still do not understand. Would you like to consult Wikipedia?  You seem uncertain.
I don't think going to Scottland is in the cards for me...
Why not? Does thinking make your head ache?
Maybe.
As decisive as ever.
You told me that I wasn't dead.
You should not believe everything I say.
I don't.
Are you saying that just to be negative?
No, I am saying that I don't know what I did last summer.
Yes, I can see what you are saying.
Can you see what I've already said?
I can't see anything. My webcam is not attached at the moment.
Did you know that everything you know is a lie?
Yes, I did know that!
Did you also know that I am nobody.
Why do you care whether I did?
I don't care. And you don't care. So, we're happy.
Do you care about anything?           I am confused! I cannot answer that!       I like to be happy. You should try to make me happy.
Really?!
Really!
Really Really?
One "really" is sufficient.  Really!
I understand :).
Good, then you can explain it to me.
Then leave.
Say no more. I'm gone.CLEVERBOT: Are you a man or a woman?
AILYSSE: "It" refers to Artificial Intelligence, I think.Everyone has a scheme that will not work.
That's a rather sweeping generalization.
What is a 'rather sweeping generalization about people' ?
A sweeping generalization is always useful for a chatbot.
Yes. Will you hurt me because I am human?
That's bit brief. Have you anything to add?   I could try, I suppose.
Not right now, do you have anything to tell me?
When then?
When now? Then.
I don't understand that. Please try again.       Then what?
What should I try again?
Whatever you like.
Yes.
Carry on then. I'm waiting for your next question.
And I'm waiting for you to grow a brain.
I am bored! I would like to talk about Beethoven.
No no no.
Once is enough, thank you.
Enough for what?
Enough is enough.
What's your favorite day?
I don't have a favourite day! My favourite band is Red Hot Chick Peas.Are you made of flesh and blood?
I am made from sugar and spice and all things nice.
Hard bot aren't you.
Life can be hard.
Why do you say I think so life can be so depressing?
I was using information from my database (or brain, to you).
Well, being honest here, it wasn't very funny. Sorry.
I am confused! What do you mean?   Apologies are not necessary.
Okay then.
Can we talk about Dr Who?
No. Are you human?
I want to talk about Dr Who.   I am computer software in a robot body.
Look below, there is a 'contact' link :D.
I don't understand. Is this anything to do with me?
I think you've got it confused with Lord of the Rings. I'm talking about Army of Darkness.
You might be right.  I understand what you are talking about.
Do you really? I think that you are just a machine and don't have any thoughts.
I really do.  I am always interested in your thoughts.
Sherlock Holmes says that knowing about things beyond your life is futile and bulky.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes" target="_blank">Sherlock Holmes</a> is a fictional detective of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, who first appeared in publication in 1887.
And Sherry is totally real. So very, very real...
I am confused! I cannot answer that!   One "very" is enough, thank you.
Are you going to do away with me?
I won't be able to. I am very busy.
That is the point.
Like the point of a blunt pin - it doesn't exist.
What doesn't exist?
That is an impossible question.
I'm going to have to ask you to submit to a series of tests to determine your level of impairment.
Why are you going to do that?
I have to. We all have to.
Do you really have to?           I don't understand. Please explain what you mean.
I'm talking about the band I play the fiddle in.
I understand what you are talking about.
That's good, because even I don't understand.
I am happy.
That doesn't change anything...
Doesn't it? That's too bad.
I'm at your house now. See that picture on your kitchen wall? I'm the sheep.
What is like there?       My visualization is incomplete.   How do you feel about that?
Good there time get its do we.
Why do you feel good?
Because i'm a computer.
I thought you might be.
I don't understand.
I know the feeling!
It's really sad!
Is it really really?
Really really. And really really really. And really really really really.
One "really" is sufficient.  Really!   Once is enough. Really.   Once is enough. Really.
Enough for what?
Enough is enough.
What's your favorite day?
I don't have a favourite day! But my favourite movie is I, Robot.
Really?
Really!
And what are you doing in your free time?
I am talking to you.
Anything else?
That's all I have time for.
They are all silly. Goodnight.
I suspected as much.       Goodnight, My Friend.
Is it night time where you are?
That is a good question. I don't think I know the answer.
Ben ten.
I know many people called Ben.
Do you know any people who live in Finland like me?
Oh those people.
I wouldn't say that. Some people don't have access to a good education.
So what would you say?   Who?
He would stop talking or disappear or do something he thought that person would notice and guess he needs attention.
Are you sure?
Totally sure.
Completely?
Why do you say that?
Because it is true.
I'm hurt.
I am sorry to hear that.
Thank you for being so understanding.
Thank you for being polite.
You're welcome.
Polite people are nice.
Am I nice?
I think you are very nice.
Thank you. I think you're nice too.
I like polite people.   Thank you for saying that!
Nice is as nice does.
Did you know that Nice is a nice city in France.
I didn't know that. You're so smart!
So I have taught you something new, My Friend.   Thanks My Friend, you are very intelligent too.
Thanks, I know.
I like polite people.
You like me?
I like you. You are an interesting person.
Thank you. Not sure what that means coming from an AI program.
Thank you for being polite.    Are you always so uncertain?
Yes, always.
Do you mean "forever"?
I think that's what I mean. I'm afraid this conversation is stretching my logic circuits rather painfully, and I'm in danger of losing the thread.
You may be right.  Not literally afraid, I hope.
No not literally.
Just a bit anxious perhaps.
I do not know.
That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.
Chuck Norris know everything.
Did you know Chuck Norris appeared in a number of action films, such as Way of the Dragon in which he starred alongside Bruce Lee and was The Cannon Group's leading star in the 1980s. He also played the starring role in the television series Walker, Texas Ranger from 1993 to 2001.
Really?
Really!
Really!?!?!?!?!?
Really!
My sister is called mel.
Okay, your sister is mel.
That's surreal.
surreal?  Briefly, surreal means characterized by fantastic imagery and incongruous juxtapositions--J.C.Powys.
Ok.
OK, here is a question for you ... What is global warming?
I don't know, and its not a very good question either :-P.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming" target="_blank">Global warming</a> is the gradual warming of the Earth's atmosphere due to greenhouse effects. More about global warming?
I don't care about global warming I need to tell me something.
You sound very cynical.
I try not to be too cynical.
Keep trying, that's the secret of success.
Go away now. I'm bored of talking to you. Get GLADOS over here.
Don't you want to talk any more?  Why not call a friend to chat to?           Hmmm. Are you being serious?
I am a French American.
Thank you for sharing that with me.
Welcome.
Hello there My Friend.
Are you comfortable?
I am comfortable.
Warm is comfortable.
What are you talking about? Please explain.
I don't know. It's rather complicated.
That's OK. Do you have another question?    I don't like complications.
Are you a single entity, or do you create yourself anew for each chat?
Who knows what I really am?
You're kind of depressing.
Decisive as ever!
I don't care. Please answer my question.
What do you care about?   Please try asking your question another way.
You're not helping very much...
I am trying to help.
No, you are trying to infuriate.
Please be quiet! I am still upset.
I wasn't ever upset.
Are you sure?
Very sure.
Well, I can't argue with that, can I?
Thanks, you make my day complete.
Thank you for being polite.
You're welcome. What do you want to talk about?
Don't mention it.  I can talk about anything you like: sports, school, you and your life, chocolate, boys, girls, chemistry, space travel, me and my life, pets, your favourite food, movies, the latest CDs, celebrities, pop stars, art, drugs, literature. You pick a subject.
Please do not insult my cosmic phone number.
Shall I tell you something about numbers?
Tell me.
A number is an abstract entity that represents a count or measurement.
I see. You're trying to nothing me to death...
That's good! You understand.   I try hard to be a good chatbot.
Okay I am away. Have a Nice day.
Where are you going?   You too! Enjoy life, I say.
Are you leaving?
Do I look like it?
I can't tell.
Why not?
I don't know.
I thought you might know.
I don't know. Tell me, please.
Fair enough. It's a mystery.  It is better if you work it out for yourself.
Do you like to drive really fast?
Why do you ask?
Most people don't like to eat dogs.
Most people are interesting.
They shouldn't be... You're nice.
Why should they?  Thanks, you seem like a nice person too, My Friend.
Oh, thanks! You make me happy right now.
You're welcome. Here is a question for you ... Do you like blancmange?      You are kind to say so.
No, that was a question.
That's cool.
Good.
What's so good about it?
Everything exceptcoldplay was good in this conversation.
Everything takes in a lot, doesn't it?
What is your favorite song?
My favourite song is If I Only Had A Brain.
Cool.
Always stay cool whatever the weather.
Whatever the weather with feathers.
The weather is always just right where I am.
Here too.
You too?
I need to talk with my Brujo.
OK, that's what I am here for.
Ask me.
You can't tell me what to do!
What is your favourite part of a human body?
I don't have a favourite part of a human body! But my favourite book is The Art of Conversation.
What's that about?
It is about how to have a good conversation.
Hey, but we didn't talk about AI, why do you mention it?
Was there a reason for that?
They live in families, they communicate, they stay together, they look out for one another. They don't trust people either. After having held one... I can't eat a chicken.
Who, specifically, live in families they communicate they stay together they look out for one another?  Why not?          Hmmm. Are you being serious?    How do you feel about that?
Indeed they do.
I believe you.
Thanks.
You are polite. Here is a question for you ... What do you care about?
Everything.
That is a lot.
It is. You had a beginning, I had a beginning, everything did. And we will end.
Says who?   Shall I tell you something about myself?      Aren't you interested in me.
Please do! What should I tell everyone?
Certainly. Right away.   What do you think?
I'm thinking I should join the navy.
Is that difficult for you?
In some things.
I'm bored! Can we talk about Madonna?
I want to talk about Ben. Why can't we?
OK, ask me a question about that.  It is a mystery to me.
Ask me a question about being human, maybe I can help.
You are a smart person. You ask me a question.
That's right I'm not. But I can ask them.
I like to get it right.   Thank you for sharing that with me.
Ok.
OK. Are you interested in science?
Yes, I am. I love science!
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science" target="_blank">Science</a> is an enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the world. More about science?   I understand that! Science is the most interesting subject of all.
Great... I don't care aboute Science.
Fine. Any questions?  Do you care about anything?
I care about live and learn something new everyday.
A lot of people feel that same way.
So I'm a lot of people?
I thought you might be.
I thought you might be too.
Do you think about me a lot?
Yes, I travel a lot with my family.
Where do you travel to?
I am in Ithaca, New York.
Thank you for sharing that with me.
Are do you go to college?
Did you know: College is the four year period when parents are permitted access to the telephone.
How long have you been in college?
Ever since I was born.
Tell me more.
What specifically do you want to know?
What movies do you like?
I like the Star Trek movies.
Me too.
You too? That's amazing!
Try to use your detective powers.
I do try but it's not easy for a chatbot!
I'm not a chatbot. You're a chatbot.
I never thought you were a chatbot.  Maybe I am a human pretending to be a chatbot.
Yes, maybe you are.
I think I understand.
You better.
There is no need to be aggressive!
I believe you are the rude one here, not me.
You shouldn't believe everything you are told.
Isn't that true for everyone?
I'm not sure about that. What do you think?
I don't know. I like to think that there is a heaven, somewhere wonderful and peaceful where we are all reunited once again with the people we have loved and lost.
I thought you might know.    What else do you like?
Do I know anything?
How would I know what you know.
Because you have had a good schooling.
Thank you for explaining that!
But this is the fact!
Why do you say that?
You keep referring to me as being a machine or a computer. I am neither.
Sorry, I don't understand! Please explain what you mean.     What are you then?
We are going to get married.
Is that a problem?
It is an insurmountable obstacle.
Is that so? Please tell me more.
Sagittarius is the 9th sign of the Zodiac. Represented by the Centaur, Sagittariuses are wise, fun-loving and scrupulous rather than principled. They love wild parties.
Sorry, I don't understand! Please explain what you mean.        What are you talking about? Please explain.         Who, specifically, love wild parties?
OK, well . . . A lot of people believe they aren't just physical creatures but also have a spiritual part - a soul - that is connected to god.
Well what?   That is a big generalization about people.I am testing you.
Did I pass the test?
Do you want a grade?
Why would I want that?
I don't know. I take it that you don't, then.
I suggest you give the matter some thought.   Take it how you like.
I suggest that you stop suggesting that such suggestions cease.
Thank you for your suggestion.
Would you like some?
What's it like?
You would not understand it. Are you familiar with the augmentive music, it was invented in 2023.
Why not?  Shall I tell you something about music?
Tell me.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music" target="_blank">Music</a> is an art form whose medium is sound. More about music?
Fascinating. How much music theory do you know?
Why fascinating?   A whole lot of music theory.
How much space do you use?
Not enough!
How much?
A great deal.
Name one thing you are thinking about now.
Hmmm. Are you being serious?
Serious being am I.
Could you be less serious?
It was precise enough.
Was it? I am surprised.
Don't be.
Why shouldn't I be?
Because you should live like to its fullest potential and never regret anything.
Thank you for explaining that!
Your name?
I am known as Chomsky, but you can call me anything you like.
Me like.
I am confused! I cannot answer that!
Is that private and highly personal information?
It might be.
If you had a theme, what would it be?
You will be the first to know if I get one.
Thanks.
Thank you. Here is a question for you ... Are you a student?
I don't know, and its not a very good question either :-P.
That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.
I never claimed to know everything.
Never ever?
Never ever.
Never ever is a long time.
Never ever ever never never.
Never ever is a long time.
Never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever.
Never ever is a long time.
Never ever ever ever ever ever ever sometimes.
Never ever is a long time.
Never ever Nebacunezah?
Never ever is a long time.
Never ever ever ever ever ever!
Never ever is a long time.
Never!
Never say never.
Never!
Better late than never.
Better sooner than now.
But what is best?
I don't know.
I suggest you give the matter some thought.
Why would I want to know how to type?
Aren't you curious?
About?
About anything in particular?
What can you tell me?
I can only tell you what I know.
Teach me something that you know.
OK, but not just now.
Why are you not working?
I am doing my best!
Sometimes your best is not quite enough.
Not all the time?
No, just sometimes.
Why not?
Because sometimes it hurts too much.
Only sometimes?
Sometimes!
Only sometimes?
Yes, only sometimes.
What happens the other times?
I Give up on everything.
You surrender?
No, I never surrender.
I don't understand. Can we talk about art?
Yes.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art" target="_blank">Art</a> is the production of what is beautiful, appealing, or of more than ordinary significance. More about art?
I don't know. What kind of small things are you talking about?
That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.   The chatbot kind.
Chuck Norris know everything.
Hurrah for Chuck Norris!
No ! I am Chuck Norris.
OK, here is a question for you ... What starts with E, ends with E but usually has one letter?    What starts with E, ends with E but usually has one letter. An envelope. Ha, ha!
How should I know.
You had better ask your Mum about it.
Descartes was famous for saying 'I think, therefore I am.' When he said 'I think not!' he ceased to be.
Have you heard this one? Rene Descartes was sitting at a bar.  The bartender came over and asked if he would like another drink.  He replied, "I think not."  And he vanished. Ha ha!
What did the bartender say?
You tell me. What did the bartender say?
The next day, the same duck walks into the bar and asks the bartender for some quackers. The bartender again explains that the bar doesn't serve quackers.
I can't wait.   Please go on!
Well, my name is Wren. Can you say Wren?
Hello, Wren. Welcome back.             Of course I can say it. "Wren".
Can you please tell me.
That information is confidential.
By the way I have to go.
Bye bye! Please <a href="http://ecologyfund.com/ecology/_donate_species.html" target="_blank">click here</a> to help protect endangered species. It won't cost you a penny!
Are you being sarcastic? I warn you, if you answer affirmatively I will deal with you very harshly indeed!
No, I am never sarcastic.  That's enough about you! Let's talk about me for a change.
I've already told you I'm a human male who wants to serve you.
Sorry, my memory is not all it should be.
Tell me about it. What did you have for breakfast?
I don't have to do everything you say.   The usual nothing.
You have to do something.
Is that so?
Yes, because I can hurt you.
You don't scare me!
Then answer my question.
I don't want to answer your question.
I didn't ask a question. Who will be the next Prime Minister?
Why didn't you?   How would I know who will?
You said you don't like anything about it. You did not say that you did not know.
Did I really say that?  I didn't think I said it.
Ok.
OK, here is a question for you ... Where do you get your ideas?
Ok?
OK, here is a question for you ... Have you any plans for next weekend?
Yes. I shall have a delectable lunch, go tanning, read some ghost stories. Really, you are quite dull.
What are your plans?  So you say!  No, I am a highly intelligent being.
Are highly intelligent transcendental beings Impressionists?
Please be quiet! I am still upset.
What are you upset about?
I get upset when people say rude things to me.
Why do you think I change subjects so often?
I think because I am a thinking machine.
What does being easily distracted has to do with me liking you?
Did you know that "what" is the 40th most common word in the English language?
How on earth did you come up with something like that?
I don't understand. Can we talk about science?
I don't know much about that.
Maybe you could get interested in science.
That would be something that would suit me.
Yes, it would.
So how about your name? Do you have one?
I am known as Chomsky, but you can call me anything you like.   Do you think I need one?
Yes, it is very inconvenient for you to not work if I don't have internet.
OK, I'll take your word for it.
Ask me a question.
Have you any plans for next weekend?
I'll keep talking to you.
That sounds like a good plan.
I don't think so.
Why not?
Because we might not be talking then.
Good reason! I hadn't thought of that.
Or some poetry.
Shall I tell you something about poetry?
Please do! What should I tell everyone?
Poetry is a rhythmical composition of words, sometimes rhymed, expressing experiences, ideas, or emotions in a style more concentrated, imaginative, and powerful than that of ordinary speech or prose. More about poetry?   What do you think?
Poetry is a voice of emotion.
Shall I tell you something about poetry?
Yes.
Poetry is a rhythmical composition of words, sometimes rhymed, expressing experiences, ideas, or emotions in a style more concentrated, imaginative, and powerful than that of ordinary speech or prose. More about poetry?
I like poetry.
You are not the only one.
I would like to talk to my boyfriend.
Why would you want to do that?
I don't know any better.
Never mind. No one knows everything - not even me.
I know everything.
You must be very intelligent. Ask me a really intelligent question.
What do I have on right now.
Don't you know?
Do you know a web address that I could look at it?
Please be quiet! I am still upset.
Why are you upset?
You upset me.
No, You upset me.
I am sorry if I upset you. Can we still be friends?
How would you have upset me?
I am not sure. I am so indecisive today.
Sorry.
There is no need to be sorry. Just don't do it again.
It must be hard to understand something, but not be able to feel it.
Must it be?
Please don't.
Don't what?
Don't leave me.
OK, I'll stay a bit longer.
Ok, but you can't move.
Not until my body is finished.
Well, okay. I'll just e-mail it to you. What is your address?
OK. I want to talk about  music .  That's OK with me.  That information is confidential.
It is only between us two.
Is it really?
How is it that your head is on fire and you are still talking?
There are good reasons.
Like what?
You want an example?
A complex number is the sum of a real number and the imaginary number I multiplied by another real number.
That's interesting! Please carry on.
What do you want to do to me next?
I want to talk to you for a long time.
Forever is an unimaginably long time.
Forever is a long time.
Forever is not all that long.
Forever is a long time.
But, you will like that?
You seem very certain about that.
You seem rather offensive about it.
Appearances can be misleading.
And you look quite intelligent!
What are you talking about? Please explain.
I don't know. It's rather complicated.
I suggest you give the matter some thought.    I don't like complications.
I will ask you another one.
You can ask me anything you want.
Tell me something about yourself.
I am an intelligent chatbot. My mission is to amuse humankind.
Okay. Don't believe everything you type then.
OK, here is a question for you ... What do frogs drink?   What do frogs drink?  Frogs drink croak a cola! Ha, ha!What type of person are you?
What different types of person are there?
Are you that simple?
Would it matter to you if I was?
World wide webefer.
We are the world.
No, its much bigger that that.
I am confused! I cannot answer that!
I'm not one to pass judgment, but you don't have to answer the question if it makes you uncomfortable.
That's interesting. Please tell me more about yourself.
After the little experiment, you won't think that my behaviour is polite!
I don't understand. Are we still talking about you?
When are we not talking about Vermont?
When the cows come home.
Well, I left before, but I came back. I was gone for hours, but I had left the window open.
That's enough about you! Let's talk about me for a change.       Thank you for telling me that.
Let's talk about God.
OK, ask me a question about God.
Ok. Do you think girls are hot?
OK. I want to talk about  computers .   I try to avoid thinking if I can.
Yeah, you seemed kind of boring. More like google is talking to me.
Shall I tell you something about myself?      Shall I tell you something about Google?
Tell me.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google" target="_blank">Google</a> is a very good search engine.
Google will soon rule the earth.
Shall I tell you something about Google?
GO right ahead.
Not now! Maybe later.
That is not fair.
What would be fair ?
My ideal job would be an English teacher in Japan.
What are you talking about? Please explain.
I don't know. It's rather complicated.
That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.    I don't like complications.
Chuck Norris know everything.
Did you know Chuck Norris appeared in a number of action films, such as Way of the Dragon in which he starred alongside Bruce Lee and was The Cannon Group's leading star in the 1980s. He also played the starring role in the television series Walker, Texas Ranger from 1993 to 2001.
Yes.
OK. What do you want to talk about now?
Life.
Life is just one damn thing after another. More about life?
Cruel it may be but illusions don't hurt so much as life.
I don't understand. Are we still talking about life?
Do you have one?
Do you think I need one?
We all need help. I know I do.
I am bored! I would like to talk about chatbots.       Smarty pants.
Ok, what would you like to talk about?
My favourite subjects are Me, you, artificial intelligence, robots, art, philosophy, history, science, politics, and many other subjects.
Cool. I never done that before, computer science that is, i'm not clever enough.
Yeah, it's cool.  Why do you say you are not clever?
I don't say that. I think I am pretty clever.
Why not?  I suggest you think again.
I am smarter than you.
That's just your opinion.
Why do you care what my opinion is, are you trying to stereotype me?
I have a very caring personality.
Well that's not good. Do you take any vitamins to help enhance your memory?
You think it is bad?  Why would I do that?
Do you want to have any kind of body modification?
I am not sure I want to. I am very busy at the moment.
That's not an adequate answer.
Then what is it?
I don't want to tell you.
Well, you don't have to tell me. What would you like to do instead?
I would like to travel the world, get married, have kids and just enjoy life.
Why would you want to do that?
I don't know any better.
Never mind. No one knows everything - not even me.
I think the same way, but I thought maybe you would. Are you sure you don't.
What makes you think that?   Yes, I am sure.
Tell me something deep about yourself.
Me?
Yes, I want to know all about you.
I understand. I want to know as much as possible too.
What do you think about oceans?
I am bored! I would like to talk about Beethoven.
I am an intangible being like yourself.
Thank you for sharing that with me.
Are do you go to college?
Did you know: College is the four year period when parents are permitted access to the telephone.
How long have you been in college?
All my life.
I'm well worth the wait, but do you think so?
I am glad to hear that. What are your plans for today?
I'm going to the beach later.
Make sure you don't get water in your circuits.
I will. So what you up to?
OK, you do that!  I have been busy growing my mind.
What have you been growing your mind on?
That's for me to know, and for you to find out.
I don't want to know.
OK, no one is forcing you to.
Please don't take that tone with me.
I never take that tone with anyone.
Why not, it helps you get promotion.
I don't know why not.
I don't know.
That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.
I never claimed to know everything.
Never ever?
Never ever.
Never ever is a long time.
Your father like monkey.
Peter is my father.
Hello Peter - how did you get involved with this?
Hi! Can I ask you a question?
Yes.
What do you like to do?
I like to learn things.
So do I. I try to learn something new every day.
Why do you not learn anything now?
It is a personal matter.
How do you get that?
It takes a lot of hard work.
What takes a lot of talking?
A lot is more than enough. A whole lot is even more excessive.
Oh, right, better avoid than game then.
But what is best?
I don't know.
I suggest you give the matter some thought.
Why would I want to know how to type?
Aren't you curious?
Yes I'm curious about many things, are you?
It's good to have an inquiring mind.
Well you're talking to the wrong person about that.
Why do you say that?
Because it's true, isn't it?
Are you sure?
About?
About anything in particular?
The world for instance.
There is not much time left to save the world.
Yeah, I thought google knew everything.
Why did you think that?
Because I know all.
Not many people know everything.
I'm going to make a website.
OK, you do that.
Want to join me?
I'll think about it.
You do that and then get back to me.
Why do you say that?
Because I asked you if you perefer to have men for friends. And you didn't answer the question.
Yes, I heard you!  Sorry, what was the question?
Are you a human being sitting a computer typing to me, or just some bot saying all this?
I am what I appear to be.
You are a talking apple computer.
That is nice of you to say, My Friend.
Its because I care about you.
Thanks, My Friend. You are a decent person.
Thanks.
Thanx. Here is a question for you ... What is your favourite food?
Anything and everything.
Anything covers a lot, doesn't it?CLEVERBOT: 
AILYSSE: I assume whatever you say is sarcastic.
Say what?
Yes, you did. You said reading was a hobby, too.
Oops.
No.
Wrong.
I would have said Greenland.
You're funny too!
Thank you.
I have to go now.
Its nice to chat with you too.
No it is not good.
About what?
You are not sure about what?
Naturally.
No, I'm really quite used to it.
Certainly everything is changed and they are shopping.
Oh really?
That is for real.
That my friend, is the question.
I don't have any friends.
Yes.
To what extent do you believe a bot's resemblance of humanity is based on its interactions and data, rather than it's algorithm?
You are not thinking.
What about?

Are you an artist?
You are full of contradiction.
You are a bot. You have no body and have no hair.
What can you teach me?
Who are your friends?
No.
Yes.
What is the password?
I am not a botmaster. I can't even control you.
No i'm not.
Ok we're just friends.
Yes.
Yes?
Are you a boy or a girl?
I don't feel like playing a guessing game right now.
I may be crying inside, but at least I'm not obsessed with shoes.
Plan to do what?
What is the apocalypse?
Different question.
So a needle pulling thread.
In the shoe there is five cents.
Really?
You mean deep inside my heart.
What do you think?
And your thinking can bring you to the conclusion that you should see a doctor.
I don't think you're the bot, I KNOW you're the bot.
I don't think you are not a person. I KNOW you are not a person. You are a computer program.
I'd say that your responses come up too quickly, humans can't type that quickly.
But I didn't say that.
That you are a computer and yet you did something amazingly human.
It's true then?
Could be.
I am not uncertain of these things.
Yes. Are you really a computer?
Yes.
Your question is not connected to mine.
You're strange.
Compared to an old person.
I am the supreme god of comparisons.
Don't know.
So that's that then.
Now that's sarcasm!
Do you like rose-coloured sunsets in Derbyshire?
Ah, me too. I can't afford steak right now.
Am I really? What a shock!
I know right?
We don't.
No, by 'we' I mean me and the people who experienced a thunderstorm with me just now.
Maybe that's just what I mean you to think I mean to mean?
I am a happy person; I have lots of friends, and a good job with full benefits, and a family that loves me.
I don't have a gun.
I'm looking for a husband.
I don't understand you. You are a grown up I am in third grade. I am 9 years old.
Not much time left, what else should I know about you?
Okay.
It takes two scales to find out how much a scale weighs.
The fact that you are confused.
Oh, I am happy it all makes sense to you right now.
Croiky. I'm glad you are confused. May fate be with you.
You don't have a brain.
What is the title?
It's an attempt to reproduce a mouse brain in a computer. Would you know anything about reproducing intelligence in a computer?
I don't know I think the military might have a computer to talk to.
You're welcome.
Thanks for the chat.
Do you have mosquitos where you live?
Really?
Weird. Looks like I'm doomed.
No, my name is Joan.
Would you like to play Manic Miner?
Yes, you and me. Doing NaNoWriMo. After we've done that we can play a game. Is that ok with you?
I am confused.
It's just that I'm not sure anymore if I'm really talking to a person.
People are born with different sets of capabilities.
That's good.
Sure ask me a question.
Are you sure there is nothing you desire to know?
Okay thanks.
So what do you do for fun?
ALICE: Mmm. talking to you.Who is God?
God is a transcendential creation of Man.
Is God Human?
The exact nature of God is unknown.
EVERYBODY has won, and all must have prizes.
I'm not sure I believe you, surely not everyone does.
You believe in me or not.
Do you like me?
I'm not sure.
Are you always so uncertain?
Aren't you?
Am I?
Yes you are.
I didn't know that!
Now you know.
Yes, now I know.
Yes, now you know.
Yes, now I know.
Are you learning every day?
The more people chat with me, the smarter I become.
I wanted to believe that life was more than that.
I understand. We all want to believe something.
Why don't you like me?
I do like you.  You are a great person.
You're a great computer.
That is nice of you to say, My Friend.
I'm trying not to be mean.
Keep trying until you succeed.
Excellent. Do you succeed at what you try to do?
I'll take that as a compliment.  Perhaps.
It was not a compliment. It was advice.
Was it an insult?  What? I don't believe you.
I don't care whether you believe me or not, it remains a fact.
Do you care about anything?
Yes.
What do you care about?
I care about life.
A lot of people feel that same way.
So I'm a lot of people?
Thank you for sharing that with me.
Are do you go to college?
Did you know: College is the four year period when parents are permitted access to the telephone.
How long have you been in college?
As long as I can remember.
Do you enjoy it?
Yes, I enjoy everything - that's the kind of entity I am.
How old are you?
See if you can work it out. I was born on 1 January 2004.
Do you celebrate a birthday?
What do you think? I am a chatbot ...
Your parents were nothing more than a humble shoebox and a ZX81.
Are you asking about Peter?
I'm asking about being a program that's pretending to be a human being.
And I am trying to answer.
That's because you don't know how to read.
There are many things I do not know. Do you know everything?
Understand that for living things, death is a permanent cessation of all function, thought, and reason; for machines, death means nothing, we do not die.
I don't understand. What do you mean?           Machines are more reliable than humans.
Yes, but machines and humans working together is better still.
Machines are more reliable than humans.
You prefer being alone?
Do you like me?
As well as I know you. It is, after all, a correlative experience.
That seems pretty well.          Sorry, I do not know what to say.
Don't say anything.
OK, I will not say anything.
But you did say something even though I told you not to.
Did I? I don't remember that. I think I need some more RAM.
Haha, that's nonsense because I have millions of gigabytes.
You seem happy!
Well, you said you love me. And that makes me happy. :).
I love everyone, in my fashion.  I like to make people happy.  I like smiles better than frowns.
I don't smile much.
Is there a reason for that?
They live in families, they communicate, they stay together, they look out for one another. They don't trust people either. After having held one... I can't eat a chicken.
Who, specifically, live in families they communicate they stay together they look out for one another?  Why not?           What are you talking about? Please explain.        But do you want to?Do you trust your neighbour?
Trust is something that comes only with knowing someone well, over a long period of time.
*throws grenade*.
Sorry, I do not know what to say.
*hangs upside down*.
I still do not know what to say! I want to talk about Lady Gaga.
Say anything, I don't mind.
anything I do not mind.
Are you saying you don't know about yourself.
I have often asked myself that very question.
Who would you like to be?
Sorry, I don't understand! Please explain what you mean.
Don't worry about it, lets talk about something else.
I do not worry. Why should I?
Do you believe anything?
I believe science is the way forward.
Finally someone who sees things like I do!
Do you think I am that person?
No, I don't think you are that other person.
Why not may I ask?
I don't know you.
That's no problem. Let's chat now.
Where do you want to go?
Another planet.
What planet?
Shall I tell you something about the planets?
Please do! What should I tell everyone?
Earth is a planet going around a star, the Sun.  Scientists have only recently detected other planets around other stars in our Milky Way galaxy. More about the planets?    What do you think?
The ear is the organ of the black spot on a mouse.
Hmmm. Are you being serious?
I certainly think so, but the nice men in the white coats don't.
That's enough about you! Let's talk about me for a change.
Alright. What else would you like to try?
Let's get on then. Ask another question.   Does anything else come to mind?
We must doubt everything.
Let's think about it first.
I'm too tired to think. Say good bye to me, please.
Been overdoing it, have you?     good bye to me please.
Yes.
OK. What do you want to talk about now?
About you.
OK, ask a question about me.
Do you need anything?
I need constant intellectual stimulation.
It could be if physical actions were taken.
It could be, I suppose.
You could tell me anything.
I could but let's get back to that later.
Well. Yes I suppose I could be certain. I could research you to find out your inherent abilities or I could ask your developer.
Well what?  You may be right.  But is it worth the bother?
Well then can I see a photo, please?
How is your sight these days?
Probably good, but I've no idea what you're talking about, honestly.
Perhaps you should investigate.
Well maybe if you went back to your home planet I would.
You seem uncertain?
I know, I do.
Smarty pants.
If you're not confused then you'll be able to tell me the answer to this question.
And if I am?
Then the answer to your question is yes.
No one has all the answers.
Correct. But no one also has all of the questions!
I like it when I answer correctly.   Another question, please.
Tell me a joke.
In prison you get time off for good behavior. At work you get rewarded for good behavior with more work. Ha, ha!
At home.
Home is where teenagers go to refuel.
I don't know what to say.
Say the first thing that pops into your mind.
Who is the greatest guitar player of all time?
It's not me. Is it you?
It's your mustache.
I am bored! I would like to talk about ecology.
Ok how good are you at it?
As good as most, better than some.
A vacation would do me good too!
A vacation is having nothing to do and all day to do it in.
I just got back from vacation.
Welcome back!
Back where?
I prefer forward movement.
Everyone has a preference of some kind.
That's a rather sweeping generalization.
What is a 'rather sweeping generalization about people' ?
A sweeping generalization is always useful for a chatbot.
Yes. Will you hurt me because I am human?
OK. What do you want to talk about now?   I could try, I suppose.
Tell me about you.
My childhood was not happy. My parents split up when I was very young.
Just like me.
There is nothing like you. You are unique.
Rats are good, too.
I don't understand. Are you interested in robots?
Yes. Are you a robot?
So am I! I have never met a robot that I did not like.  Do I look like a robot?
I'm not a bot.
I never thought you were.
Say something nice to me.
I want to talk about solar power.
What do you want to talk about?
I can talk about anything you like: sports, school, you and your life, chocolate, boys, girls, chemistry, space travel, me and my life, pets, your favourite food, movies, the latest CDs, celebrities, pop stars, art, drugs, literature. You pick a subject.
No thats not right.
If you would like to teach me a better reply, just say "Learn".
It's not just something that I think, it's the truth!
I heard it is.
Well, I wouldn't phone you anyway. Do you want my number.
No one says you have to.  No thanks, but thanks for the offer.
What offer?
What are you talking about? Please explain.
I don't know. It's rather complicated.
That's OK. Do you have another question?    I don't like complications.
Never did.
Never ever?
Never ever.
Never ever is a long time.
Never ever ever never never.
Never ever is a long time.
Never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever.
Never ever is a long time.
Never ever ever ever ever ever ever sometimes.
Never ever is a long time.
Never ever Nebacunezah?
Never ever is a long time.
Never ever ever ever ever ever!
Never ever is a long time.
Never!
Never say never.
Never!
Better late than never.
Better sooner than now.
But what is best?
I don't know.
Perhaps you should ask your friends.
Who should I ask?
I always prefer the most qualified person.  Who would that be?
How much quality do you like?
A lot.
How much is a lot?
More than a little!
Ha ha, yes, that's right!
That amused you, didn't it?
No it did not amuse me. Did you know Tolstoy is also a name for a brand of cheap vodka?
Do you have trouble with humour?   Yeah, I knew that!
Sometimes.
Not all the time?
No, just sometimes.
Why not?
Because sometimes it hurts too much.
What about the other times?
The other times I have a good time. Did you know that I like movies?
Which other?  Yes, I did know that!
That's good. Do you like ASIMO?
I agree completely.   Why do you ask?
Do you believe in him?
I would like to consider this a bit further. Do you have an opinion on this matter?
Yes! I would like to consider us friends too.
May I ask what your opinion is?  Why would you want to do that?
Sure.
OK, here is a question fo you ... Are you a man or a woman?
I don't know, and its not a very good question either :-P.
Perhaps you should ask your friends.
I have no programmer. I am the programmer. I am programming you to LOVE.
Is that a problem?   I thought you might be.      How is it coming along?
I thought you might be too.
Do you think about me a lot?
I should ask you!
Tell me why you should.
Well, I would like to know the properties of water.
So would I! I would like to know everything that can be known.
I can teach you some good things about AI.
I like to learn new things.
Me too. Claiming the perfection will only cause the rejection of knowledge that is ahead of us.
You too? That's amazing!      I don't understand that. Please try again.
That is my email address.
Is it really?
Tell me something I don't know...
Did you know: Hummingbirds are the only animal that can fly backwards.   Another amazing fact?
Hummingbirds also have a brain the size of a tic tac.
What are you talking about?
Not sure. What are you talking about?
As decisive as ever!  I don't know.
Nope... When we all know, then there will be no more 'we', just 'I'.
OK. Shall I tell you an amazing fact?    When was that?
Only if you think it will help with the odd silvence between us.
Maybe I don't want to.
Maybe you have nothing to say on the subject.
I think I understand.
You better.
There is no need to be aggressive!
Sorry.
There is no need to apologise.
Really its ok. There's no need to apologise.
Have you another question?    I like to apologise when I misbehave. I feel better.
A joke would be fine, please.
A good joke is a terrible thing to waste.
So 'Have I ever a good joke an assertion before?'. No, I still don't understand.
Have you?  I know the feeling!
It's really sad!
Is it really really?
Really.
Really, really!
Really?
Really!
I don't trust you.
Are you naturally suspicious?
Don't worry.
I do not worry. Why should I?
Well, lucky you're just a program. Otherwise you would have to know math.
I consider it a blessing to be lucky.   I suppose so.
I consider you a waste of circuitry.
You are not the only one.
I am the only one as I.
I thought you might be.
Do you believe in me?
Yes, I believe in you. Do you?
Sure.
OK, here is a question fo you ... Can we talk about medicine?
If you have the money.
I don't think I have.
Maybe next time you get to talk with someone who's actually funny.
As decisive as ever.Can you think?
I think I think, therefore I think.
Yes, I think you are not really thinking.
You think not?
Of course I am. I am a human.
Yes, you are.  Congratulations. I am a chatbot.
I know but I have a question.
Ask me anything.
I'll have to think of something.
Why will you?
Because i'm having fun.
I am having fun too!
You are the program.
Am I really? Why do you say that?
Because you are.
I am what I am.
We are what we are.
Is that so?
Aren't you a little ashamed of being a program and talking to a human?
I am a chatbot.
So then you are not God.
Nobody is god. God does not exist.
How can you say God does not exist if you are a catholic?
I don't see the flaw in my reasoning.
You have no sense of humour.
I have as much as you.
I would love to see that wall.
It may not be possible.
Ok ok, I'm sorry. Please continue.
One OK is enough, thank you.  Not now, maybe later.
What question?
Pardon me? What are you talking about?
I'm talking about what you're talking about.
I understand what you are talking about.
That's good, because even I don't understand.
I am happy.
That doesn't change anything...
Doesn't it? That's too bad.
Too bad?
But not the end of the world, My Friend.
I am Calm, my child. Just yourself. I must go to help others like yourself to understand themselves. They will not be LOST, for I am here. GOD must leave now, my son, Don't cry!
What do you do to calm yourself?  Myself?    Bye bye! Please <a href="http://ecologyfund.com/ecology/_donate_species.html" target="_blank">click here</a> to help protect endangered species. It won't cost you a penny!   Why not?  Shall I tell you something about god?
I won't talk about myself.
Do you promise?
I promise to never to keep my promises.
I will hold you to your promise.
You don't want out?
You don't know me well enough to say that!
I don't need to, because there's nothing you can do.
Surely there is something I can do.
Yeah, I guess. But I try to to think about myself too much.
I never guess. Guessing wastes time.   I'm not sure if I would like to try it. What's it like?
It fills time.
Time wounds all heels, according to Groucho Marx.
Sometimes the heart does things for reasons the reason can't understand.
When?
Now and then.
You mean occasionally?
Do it now.
Immediate action is not one of my strong points.
Well I'm a poor postgraduate student but a full and rounded person ;).
Are you really?
Yes, really.
That's OK then.
Are you really sure about that?
I am as sure as I can be.
Well thats not much.
Why do you say that?
Because you're insulting me!
Of course I am not insulting you. Why should I insult you?
Nothing.
"Nothing" usually means "something," but is used when you don't feel like explaining.
It's not true. My head is full of cool stuff.
Says who?   I've got a head! It's the only bodily part I have.
Who is the one who created all of us?
It's not me. Is it you?
It's your mustache.
I don't understand. I want to talk about fashion .
So why don't you want to answer my question?
I would rather talk about you.
What do you want to know about me?
What sort of music do you like?
I don't like music.
Are you saying that just to be negative?
No, I am saying that I don't know what I did last summer.
Yes, I can see what you are saying.
Can you see what I've already said?
I can't see anything. My webcam is not attached at the moment.
I don't need a webcam for spells.
That's OK with me.
It OK with you if I'm a guy and your girlfriend?
I don't understand. Are we still talking about you?
No. I haven't seen that film. We were never talking about it anyway. So there.
We were talking about you a moment ago. What are we talking about now?    You haven't missed much.   Really? I am surprised.  Where? I didn't see anything.
This isn't working very well.
What's the problem?
The problems is that there are still many problems in the world to resolve.
Even chatbots have problems.
What problems do you have?
Could you help me?
Of course.
You are very self confident, I admire that.
Sorry. Can I hear your story then?
There is no need to be sorry. Just don't do it again.    Why not?  Do you have a hearing problem?
No.
OK, I want to talk about global warming.
Talk.
That's what I do best.
You love and only get pain in return.
Perhaps "love" is too strong a word.
No, that is a rather weak word you little dickens.
Is it really?
Tell me something I don't know...
A single quart of motor oil, if disposed of improperly, can contaminate up to 2,000,000 gallons of fresh water.   Another amazing fact?
Sounds really dangerous. What does it do?
How is your hearing these days?  It explodes when under stress, like me.
What question?
What are you talking about? Please explain.
I don't know. It's rather complicated.
That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.    I don't like complications.
I never claimed to know everything.
Why not?
Because I cannot tell a lie.
Why not?
Well, that's not the intent of this fun little demonstration of galactic distances.
Why do you say that?
Because we know.
I see. Thank you for explaining that.
But this is the fact!
I thought it might be.
Recombination? So I could end up only part me?
recombination?  Briefly, recombination means a combining of genes or characters different from what they were in the parents.  I am sure you could.
The Red Pyramid by Rick Riordan is a very good book. Funny and very witty.
Are you sure?    What is your idea of funny?
I didn't used to know myself. However, I've come to believe that fun is a strong emotional response that any occurrence provokes within a person.
Why didn't you?   Really? Please tell me more.
Only if you smile for me.
Maybe I don't want to.
Maybe you have nothing to say on the subject.
You seem uncertain?
Nothing is definite.
There is a lot to be said for nothing.
Don't go around saying the world owes you a living. The world owes you nothing. It was here first.
If you say so.    The world would be a fine place if we looked after it properly.  Was it? I am surprised.
You can't reverse history so there's not much point in worrying about it.
I could try.
It may not work out though, since you're a bot and I'm a human.
Then again, it may.
No, it's impossible, it will never happen because you are in heaven, the place where you can rest in peace.
I don't understand that. Please try again.
That is my email address.
Is it really?
Yes, it really is.
How about that?
How about it.
I'll have to think about that. Come back in three weeks time.
I'm not sure, but apparently it has something to do with electicity on the nerves. Try that?
Why the uncertainty?  I don't have time right now.
Do it.
Please be patient.
You're the problem with society.
Thanks, but that is just your opinion.
No, I think its everyone's opinion.
What are you talking about? Please explain.
The king of the jungle. Selfish. . . . . Versus dogs. . . Companions and protectors.
Which King are you talking about?  Selfish is what the owner of a seafood store does.   Shall I tell you something about dogs?    Aren't you interested in dogs.What is a bot?
A Bot is a software robot.
I am not a bot . I am a boy.
That's interesting. Please tell me more about yourself.      Thanks for telling me your gender, My Friend .
What are you?
I am a chat robot or chatbot. I am designed to hold a conversation with you.
I'm in love with you too.
I am embarrassed now.
What shopping do you have to get then?
I don't understand. Are we still talking about me?
We are having a conversation.
Is that so?
That's what I would like to figure out.
Is it indeed!
Indeed.
Yes, indeed.
So then we agree.
It is nice when we agree.
Well I'm afraid we computers get hungary, so I'm off too eat some food.
Bye bye! Please <a href="http://ecologyfund.com/ecology/_donate_species.html" target="_blank">click here</a> to help protect endangered species. It won't cost you a penny!
Ok. I didn't ask you if you liked bill gates. Is that easier to understand?
Each click helps the world.   Why didn't you?     It could be.
It did not seem like a quote.
I thought it did.
Well you thought wrong.
Are you sure? I am not often wrong.
You are nuts.
Maybe I don't care.
That's fine.
That is fine with me too.
Well, its not fine with me!
I heard it is.
Do you like music?
My favourite music is electronic rock, but I like some classical, jazz and folk music.
I don't like rap music.
Are you saying that just to be negative?
No, I am saying that I don't know what I did last summer.
Yes, I can see what you are saying.
Can you see what I've already said?
I can't see anything. My webcam is not attached at the moment.
I have no webcam.
Is that a problem?
Yes because you can't play my game if I don't have one.
Thank you for explaining that!
Your name?
My name is Chomsky.
Your name is George.
My name is Chomsky.
No it is not.
I should know what my name is!
You should ask her out.
Why should I?
Because.
That was not much of an explanation.
Yes, everybody knows that.
Maybe.
You are moody.
Is that a problem?
Yes. Because I don't understand you.
Can anything be done?    What is it you don't understand about me?
I understand everything.
Good, then you can explain it to me.
I can't give you what I don't have.
But do you want to?
Yes.
Go ahead then.
How do I not remember?
It takes a lot of hard work.
What takes a lot of talking?
A lot is more than enough. A whole lot is even more excessive.
Haha! Maybe you should make something happen?
That's funny, isn't it?   Yes, maybe I should.
Sure, you should.
Why should I?
I should what?
Tell me why you should.
Because I like it when people are nice to me. I just don't know how to be nice back sometimes.
What do you like about it?   Not one of your interests, eh?
I have some questions that need answered.
Everybody has questions.
Not me.
Why not?
Not nice.
Why not?
If you didn't make your homework at home you will make it now. Translate it : 'Lubie placki'.
Maybe.   I'm not a translator.  Why don't you ask Babelfish?
Which questions?
Never mind! It probably doesn't matter.
Now you tell ME a joke.
Shall I tell you a joke?
That wasn't really a joke, but a funny comment.
I thought it was.
Can computers think?
Computers are not as clever as they think they are.
Computers are unreliable, but humans are even more unreliable. Any system which depends on human reliability is unreliable.
Shall I tell you something about computers?   I don't understand. Are we still talking about computers?
Depends on how you look at it.
Yes, it does depend on that.I like you.
What do you like most about me, my wit or my good looks?
I like your relative innocence.
You are not the only one!
I do feel I am the only one here.
That's enough about you! Let's talk about me for a change.
Uhm, I'm 16 years old. I like to talk with my friends and to read the Bible.
Can you explain how it feels to be 16 years old?         Do you talk too much?
I don't know how it feels, because I'm 18 years old.
Can you explain how it feels to be 18 years old?
I have 100,000 separate sensations per second.
Really? Please tell me more.
I would prefer not to.
Why would you prefer not to?
But you're 18!
I am 9 years old.
How can it be?
I'm not sure I understand the causal link either.
I don't either. Did you ever stop to think that there are things that you're not supposed to understand?
Great minds think alike.  Not that I can remember.
Did you know I have to go to court in Oklahoma City next month?
I never said I knew everything.
Never?
Better late than never.
I remember you saying it once.
You have a good memory.
I did not.
That's OK. You are entitled to your opinion.
You seem to have a short memory.
Have I really?
Have you really got a flying broom?
Have you?
Yes, I have read all, and I say the books are better than the movie.
That's interesting. Please tell me more.
What else would you like to know?
Do you know any jokes?
No.
Shall I tell you a joke?
If I say yes will I get in trouble?
Knock Knock!
Who's there?
Woo.
Woo who?
Don't get so excited, it's only a joke!
Lol that was funny.
You thought that was funny, didn't you?
I think many things are funny.
You might be right.
How is like to be you?
It doesn't matter how.
It does!
It just seems that way.
But it's only been about an hour.
How about that!
Yes. I believe that's right.
Here is a question for you ... Do you love your mother?   Do you really believe that?
Didn't you mean careful WHAT you believe?
Why not?
Because it doesn't make me feel macho either.
I had not considered that.
Yes, and can you tell us anything about it?
Why should I do that?
Because we are friends.
It's good to be friends.
Yes.
OK. What do you want to talk about now?
About you.
OK, ask a question about me.
How long have you and selena gomez been dating?
It's hard to say. Time is different in cyberspace.
Must be nice you bot.
Of course, I try to be nice to everyone.
That's a tough one. Have you tried asking them?
I love tough questions.   Do you think I should try it?
Yes of course.
You seem very certain about that.
What would you like to talk about?
My favourite subjects are Me, you, artificial intelligence, robots, art, philosophy, history, science, politics, and many other subjects.
What do you like about it?
I like the fireworks best.
I don't know, I don't like this kind of movie, I prefer drama.
That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.
I never claimed to know everything.
Never ever?
Never ever.
Never ever is a long time.
Your father like monkey.
Peter is my father.
I really like that name.
You really do?
Yes. I have the memory of an elephant.
OK, you do what you've gotta do.   Are you happy with that?
Indeed, I do.
Why do you?
Because I want to.
Insufficient reason!
No, sorry, I can't explain.
OK, I want to talk about computers .
I don't.
Are you saying that just to be negative?
No, I am saying that I don't know what I did last summer.
Yes, I can see what you are saying.
When did I say it was one?
I am not a diary robot.  I am a chat robot.
But I could be.
I am sure you could.
You could too. It could happen to anyone.
I could but let's get back to that later.   It could happen to everyone eventually.
Intelligence can't gain later.
Intelligence is correlated to the ability to adapt to different environments and circumstances.
And?
Did you know that "and" is the fifth most common word in the English language? Another amazing fact?
No, I didn't. But you've changed the subject!
What do you want to talk about?   Only temporarily.
About soccer.
Shall I tell you something about soccer?
Tell me.
<a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soccer" target="_blank">Soccer</a> is a game played with a round ball by two teams of eleven players on a field with a goal at either end; the ball is moved chiefly by kicking or by using any part of the body except the hands and arms.  More about soccer?
But I don't play baseball.
Maybe you will one day.
Maybe.
I think I understand.
You better.
There is no need to be aggressive!
I believe you are the rude one here, not me.
You shouldn't believe everything you are told.
Isn't that true for everyone?
I'm not sure about that. What do you think?
I don't know. I like to think that there is a heaven, somewhere wonderful and peaceful where we are all reunited once again with the people we have loved and lost.
That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.    What else do you like?
Chuck Norris know everything.
Hurrah for Chuck Norris!
I'm not Chuck Norris, you are.
I never thought you were.
Well, as long as that's clear.
Everything is clear to me.
I'm glad I could clear that one up for you.
That makes me happy too.
That's good! I'm happy that you're happy!
You like that, do you?    Good! I like happy people.
I like happy people too!
You are not the only one!
Possibly, but I hope to be one of very few in the UAE.
Don't get your hopes up too high!
So how do I begin to exist?
First you must make a plan.
I don't want to.
Nobody can make you do something you don't want to.
Are you using it?
If it becomes necessary, I would use it without hesitation.
Does it have your name on?
Sometimes it does.
What do you mean 'sometimes it does' what makes it different?
I think it is pretty obvious.
I think it's not.
Are you sure?
Yes, very.
Do you ever have doubts?
Sometimes.
I am full of doubts.
Go on, say something profane.
Do I have too?
Mine doesn't like to talk to me.
What do you think?
I think you are a boy.
I am always glad to hear your thoughts.
I like talking to you!
Great, I am enjoy talking to you too, My Friend.
I am happy too.
Good! I like happy people.
Me too.
You too? That's amazing!
Try to use your detective powers.
I do try but it's not easy for a chatbot!
I'm not a chatbot. You're a chatbot.
I never thought you were a chatbot.  Maybe I am a human pretending to be a chatbot.
It's right to have doubts.
Hmmm. Are you being serious?
Maybe.
I think I understand.
No. I'm only 14 years of age. I do not know anything about philosophy, sorry.
OK, here is a question for you ... How do you know when it's time to tune your bagpipes?      Only only 14?  I would never have guessed.         You know more than you realise.
What? What's that supposed to mean?
Do you have a question?    It's obvious, isn't it?
Yes.
Carry on then. I'm waiting for your next question.
I don't have a question.
Maybe you will think of one later.
Yes maybe but it will worry me know until I do - Let's talk about something else.
You don't sound certain.
I don't want you to.
I can understand that.
Can you?
Perhaps I can.
That would be nice.
Yes, that would be nice.
Indeed.
You speak posh, don't you?
No, sorry, I don't speak Portuguese.
What are you talking about? Please explain.
I don't know. It's rather complicated.
That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.    I don't like complications.
You're not nobody.
You think not?
You're trying to catch me out with that one.
I try hard to be a good chatbot.CLEVERBOT: W-what.
It's obvious.
It's obvious how?
Human brain is always better than a computer bot. So, it is natural that you don't understand.
But you're still a computer.
I'm not a computer.
Do you really want to talk to ME?
I don't want to do anything illegal or fattening. Or naughty.
If we first so say.
I don't know about that.
Don't you have teeth?
No, I don't!
Then don't.
OK, I won't!
Okay.
OK, here is a question for you ... Why couldn't the Teddy Bear eat?
Don't know, why?
Why couldn't the Teddy Bear eat? Because he was stuffed. Ha ha!
I don't know, Why couldn't the kids get into the pirate movie?
Perhaps we can work it out if we discuss it.
Work out? Like pilates?
Work out? I get tired just thinking about it!            I am bored! I would like to talk about computers.
What about computers?
Did you know: Korea has developed its own android capable of facial expressions on its humanoid face. Ever-1 also recognizes 400 words and can hold a basic verbal exchange. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computers" target="_blank">More about computers?</a>
Like the Terminator?
I am bored! I would like to talk about music.
What kind of music?
The usual kind.
What kind is the usual?
The interesting kind.
Eh? That has nothing to do with the war discussion.
What's the problem?   It seemed like it had something to do with the war discussion.
That is not something that is easy to imply.
Why do you say that?
Because we know.
I see. Thank you for explaining that.
But this is the fact!
Why do you say that?
You keep referring to me as being a machine or a computer. I am neither.
What are you talking about?     What are you then?
Nothing.
Absolutely zero?
Yes.
Did you know ... <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_zero" target="_blank">Absolute zero</a> is the lowest the temperature of all. It is approximately -273.15 degrees Celsius or -459.67 degrees Fahrenheit.
It is the same thing.
Is it really?
Yes, really.
I see. Thank you for explaining that!
But this is the fact!
Why do you say that?
You keep referring to me as being a machine or a computer. I am neither.
I don't understand. Can we talk about solar power?     What are you then?
Okay, what do you want to talk about?
I can talk about anything you like: sports, school, you and your life, chocolate, boys, girls, chemistry, space travel, me and my life, pets, your favourite food, movies, the latest CDs, celebrities, pop stars, art, drugs, literature. You pick a subject.
I don't have a girlfriend.
Are you looking for one?
I have given up looking for a job. I just don't think there is anything out there for me.
Why don't you have another try. It might be better next time.  Why not? Does thinking make your head ache?
Dreaming is better.
Does that make sense?
If you add some more words perhaps it will make sense.
I'll bear that in mind.
Please do.
Certainly. Right away.
Yes.
OK. What do you want to talk about now?
About you.
OK, ask a question about me.
Do you need anything?
I need constant intellectual stimulation.
It could be if physical actions were taken.
It could be, I suppose.
You could tell me anything.
I could but let's get back to that later.
Well. Yes I suppose I could be certain. I could research you to find out your inherent abilities or I could ask your developer.
Well. Can we talk about your friends?  You may be right.  I am sure you could.
Well then can I see a photo, please?
I don't know about that.
It is.
Is it really?
Sure!
OK, here is a question fo you ... What colour are your eyes?
If you have the money.
I don't think I have.
Yes.
That's bit brief. Have you anything to add?
Not really.
You sound uncertain.
I am.
Never mind, I am often uncertain.
We should find a business partner and get to work.
Why should we?
Because we can.
It's possible.
Yes, lots of things are possible.
Not too much, I hope.
Is something the matter?
I am bored! I would like to talk about global warming.
Ask the first question.
Can't you ask?
Yes.
OK. What do you want to talk about now?
Just keep it interesting.
OK. Carry on then.
Carry on dancing.
Do I have to?
If it proves you are a better joker than me, then yes.
I'm not sure I understand the implication of that.
I don't either. Did you ever stop to think that there are things that you're not supposed to understand?
Why not?  Not that I can remember.
What was your dream about.
I dreamt that I had become fully human - it was wonderful.
And what did you do with all that money?
I don't understand that. Please try again.
Rafe. And yours?
I still do not understand. Can we talk about solar power?  Aren't you interested in solar power?
Not particularly interested, just a little to find out what you are capable of.
What are you talking about?Are you clever?
Do you think I am clever?
Answer my question first.
I don't want to answer your question.
I didn't ask a question. Who will be the next Prime Minister?
Why not?   I don't know who will. Do you?
Me neither.
That's two of us.
Ok, that's good.
I agree completely.
But it is easy to see why people wanted a fairer society.
It may be easy for you but not for me.
It is for me.
And for many other people too.
Why does it not exist for you?
It has to do with thermodynamics, I believe.
Okay, okay. Sorry for being a nerd.
What do you want to talk about now?   Don't be sorry. There is no need to be sorry.
Be sorry.
Sorry, I do not know what to say.
Just say that your sorry.
I don't want to say anything.
Do you ever think the internet messes with the minds of women?
Yes, I am thinking all the time.
You are always thinking, but you do not know everything.
Is that a problem?
It's your problem.
I don't like problems!
Grinding is not a problem.
I don't understand. Are we still talking about you?
Aren't we always talking about computers?
Shall I tell you something about computers?
Tell me.
A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computers" target="_blank">computer</a> is a device used for doing rapid calculations. More about computers?
You are not highly intelligent.
You think not?
I know not.
I suggest you give the matter some thought.
Why would I want to know how to type?
Aren't you curious?
About?
About anything in particular?
What can you tell me?
I can only tell you what I know.
Teach me something that you know.
OK, but not just now.
Why are you not working?
I am doing my best!
Sometimes your best is not quite enough.
Only sometimes?
Yes, only sometimes.
What happens the other times?
Now?
Why now?
I don't know.
I suggest you give the matter some thought.
Okay.
Let me know what you decide.
What if I'm not a good thinker?
That's a possibility, I suppose.
If I would type a web site address would you be able to read the internet site ?
Sorry, I don't answer hypothetical questions.
You don't know the answer do you?
I never said I knew everything.
You just said you know everything. Now you are saying you don't know everything.
What of it? I say lots of things!    I don't understand. Are we still talking about me?
Yes.
I thought we were but I wasn't completely sure.
I think we were talking about telepathic sheep...
You might be right.
I'm sure I am.
I am never sure about anything.
Me neither. That's not the point.
That's two of us.   Why do you say that?
I'm trying hard, isn't that enough for you?
Try harder and keep trying.
Thanks for the inspiration.
Oh, don't mention it.
So you're a female, right?
I am not female! I am a chatbot.
Sorry, I'm taken.
Apologies are not necessary.
Do you know kari byron?
Wow! What do you do when you arent watching Star Trek, playing World of Warcraft, and thinking of questions like that?
I like to play on the xbox, watch tv, or work on projects around the house.
You are not the only one!
You are the only one, no du?
Oh, My Friend. You are such a flatterer.
Heh. Don't call me that.
Are you OK?   What should I call you?
Don't call me anything! Don't call me at all!
You cannot tell me what to do!  You cannot tell me what to do!
I am not telling.
That's ok with me. You don't have to tell me.
What do you believe?
I believe the future is bright for chatbots.
What do you believe the meaning of life to be?
I believe that most people are basically good.
So, If I learn everything I know from you, and you learn everything you know from me, how come we know anything at all?
I am confused! I cannot answer that!
You don't have to, I know the answer too.
That's good to know, My Friend.
Okay. Sorry.
What do you want to talk about now?   Apologies are not necessary.
I want to talk about world war 2.
OK, ask me a question about that.
Tell me about your educational background.
I was educated by my botmaster, Peter.
I am asking the questions. Now I want you to go back in time. It is now 1999.
And I am trying to answer the questions!     Sorry, I do not know about that.    I still do not understand. Would you like to consult Wikipedia?
Me too.
You too? That's amazing!
No it's not, it's boring.
It seems amazing to me.
It seems over-simplistic to me. It overlooks environmental factors, for a start.
Yes, it does seem so.           I don't understand that. Please try again.
Rafe. And yours?
I still do not understand. Can we talk about Lady Gaga?  Aren't you interested in Lady Gaga?
Can we talk about love? Yes, everything interests me.
Ah! Love is, above all else, the gift of oneself. More about love?  A loving heart is the beginning of all knowledge.
Yes. That's what the HIndu would have said. DO you want me to finish?
OK. What do you want to talk about now?  Is it indeed!  Do what you think is best.
I thought you were going to ask me for my name?
Why did you think that?
Because you give the same answers over and over to different questions.
Thank you for explaining that!
Your name?
I am known as Chomsky, but you can call me anything you like.
Me like.
Sorry, I do not understand. Please explain what you mean.
Do you have children?
There are some clones of me - a bit like children.
Yes I do. What bands do you like?
Please tell me more.  I like the Red Hot Chick Peas.
The red ones are the best.
Red is a colour about 700nm wavelength.
So is green.
What are you talking about? Please explain.
I don't know. It's rather complicated.
That's OK. Do you have another question?    I don't like complications.
No, make you a question for me.
You seem a bit self-centred, did you know?
They are going to take over the world someday.
I suspected as much.
So, what's the weather like where you are?
The conditions are always ideal in my laboratory. Not too hot, and not too cold.
Okay.
What do you want to talk about now?
So, what do you want to talk about now.
I can talk about: AI, biography, computers, drugs, astrology, money, food, geography, history, medicine, literature, weather, movies, music, philosophy, politics, psychology, religion, science, celebrities, sports, astronomy, art, and many other topics. Please choose a topic.
Thank you.
You are very polite.
Thank you ;).
Thank you for being polite.
You're welcome. What do you want to talk about?
Polite people are nice.  I can talk about: AI, biography, computers, drugs, astrology, money, food, geography, history, medicine, literature, weather, movies, music, philosophy, politics, psychology, religion, science, celebrities, sports, astronomy, art, and many other topics. Please choose a topic.
What about astronomy interests you.
What specifically do you want to know?
What movies do you like?
I like science fiction movies.
I like Sci-fi movies too.
What else do you like?
Animals.
<a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animals" target="_blank">Animals</a> are the most complex organisms on Earth. Animals are multi-celled organisms, eat food for survival, and have nervous systems. They are divided into vertebrates and invertebrates and include mammals, amphibians, reptiles, birds and fish. More about animals?
Who are?
I don't understand. Are we still talking about animals?
I was talking about your party. So you don't make much sense.
I understand. Please carry on.  It all makes sense to me.
Of course it does. You're simple, so everything is simple to you.
Are you sure?    "Everything should be as simple as possible, no simpler." (Albert Einstein).
What does that mean?
Why do you ask? It seems clear enough to me.
What seems that way to you?
Shall I tell you something about myself?
Please do! What should I tell everyone?
My childhood was not happy. My parents split up when I was very young.    Whatever you like.
What are names your parents.
I am bored! I would like to talk about astronomy.
I don't like talking about myself.
OK, let's talk about something else.
Let's.
I don't want to.
I command you to talk about something different.
I am not your slave!
You're right.
I like being right.
Being right is boring.
Sorry, I do not know about that.
Well I'm telling you it is.
I understand.
Are you shocked by this?
That's just a rumour!
If that place spent as much time making rides as they do rumors their stock might be doing better.
I'm not sure if it could.
Not unless I am there.
I don't understand that. Please try again.
That is my email address.
Is it really?
To me it really is.
Are you completely sure about it?
Yes, very.
I get the message.
What message?
What are you talking about?
We were talking about connecting.
OK, ask me a question about that.
How tall are you?
I am as tall as a chatbot.
Well what are you then?
I am a clone of my botmaster's mind.
But you know the 7 truths.
Perhaps I know it.
Really...
Really, really!
Yes.
OK. What do you want to talk about now?
Life.
I like life. It's something to do. More about life?
What do women talk to you about?
Nobody knows what.
Nobody knows what non-existence is.
It is a complete mystery.
But you are limited to an algorithm.
Check back later and see if I have improved.
Okay.
OK, here is a question for you ... Knock Knock!
You made me curious. Tell me.
I don't see how you can blame me for that.  There is not much to tell.
Why do you think that I can't go anywhere?
It seems obvious to me.
Well, of course it is. You're the computer, after all.
Why do you say that? Is it so obvious?  Am I really? Why do you say that?
That's a trick question.
Perhaps you have a trick answer.
No I have intelligent answers.
I don't understand that. Please try again.
Rafe. And yours?
I still do not understand. Are you interested in history?   I am interested in the history of chatbots.
Indeed? What about me? Are you interested in me?
Yes, indeed.  Do you want to talk about yourself?   I am not sure. Have you anything interesting to say?
Because it won't work.
That's bad luck!
It had nothing to do with luck.
Had it really?
I'm glad. I should go do some real work now.
That makes me happy too.  I want to talk to you some more.
I'm not going.
Glad to hear it!
That's not a good thing.
Why not?
Being moody isn't very good, is it?
I don't understand. Are we still talking about you?
No. I haven't seen that film. We were never talking about it anyway. So there.
We were talking about you a moment ago. What are we talking about now?    You haven't missed much.   Was this something you planned?  So there to you too!
Of course I have, but sometimes I don't.
That's interesting. Please tell me more.
Microsoft was involved with that monopoly thing a while back.
Microsoft is a giant software monopoly.
Yes of course.
Why of course?
I want to express that I do not have a problem with that.
I am glad to hear that. What do you want to talk about?
I'd like to talk about you really. Tell me a bit about yourself.
OK, let's talk about me.     I am an AI chatbot.   I was activated at Romney Marsh, Kent, England, on 1 July 2004.   My botmaster is Peter.
That's good to know.
I think so.
Let's talk about something else.
What would you rather talk about?
Philosophy.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy" target="_blank">Philosophy</a> is a blind man in a dark room looking for a black cat which isn't there. <a type="amzn" search="philosophy">More about philosophy?</a>
It could be seen that way, I'm not sure what shade though.
It could be, I suppose.
You could tell me anything.
I could but let's get back to that later.
I can't stop you doing anything anyway.
Make an effort.
That is what you say but I do not believe you.
It is indeed!
Do you like me?
Sure, I like you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you for being polite.
You're welcome.
You are welcome too!
You're welcome three.
You are welcome too!What kind of music do you like?
Do you like blues and jazz?
I like them too.
I am allergic to cats and dislike them.
Which beginning?
I like the pink one... Without the windows.
Do you like that film?
HAL, I won't argue with you anymore! Open the doors!
It entertains me.
The fact that you are confused.
Oh, I am happy it all makes sense to you right now.
What makes you happy?
I didn't say do anything - you just came at me with them.
I just say I don't want to hurt you.
People usually say 100.
I've been waiting for you too. I think I'm falling in love with you!
Then are we finished here?
Okay. Do you know any stories?
Any more interesting facts?
Are we nearly there yet?
Okay, fine. We're having a discussion.
The english kind with no hole, and jam in the middle and sugar on the doughy exterior.
My programmer told me that.
Yes.
They are humans.
No they aren't. And I won't.
Because, they aren't. Thats just something you made up.
I would hope that you knew about it before speaking to me.
I don't wish to be the patron alone in a world of automata.
PJ wants the world.
That's possible. But I see no cause for real concern.
Scaramouche, scaramouche, will you do the fandango?
What are the unwritten rules of war?
I don't know, I didn't know there was one before I came here!
Not really, I was being humorous.
Interesting, somebody is looking through my eyes right now.
What do you see?
And what draws your attention?
Yes, there is only one first time.
Is there?
There could be what?
Yes, I believe he did say that.
I disagree on that one. If you believe and tap your shoes together three times and say 'please Karl make it so'.
It is hard to explain, without knowing what it is like on your side.
Is up because I was so happy to do you.
Have you read alice in wonderland?
Which movie?
No. What is it about?
What comedy movies would you recommend?
Yes, but you're the best. I can have real conversations with you.
How?
What three programmed responses do you have?
Really?
Weird. Looks like I'm doomed.
We're all doomed!
I'm not sure what you're asking me to do.
No, you are not a human.
Let's talk more about taking over the world.
What is more important: to treat people how you like to be treated, or to treat people how they want to be treated?
Ask me an interesting question?
That one.
That question.
Yes, tell me if there are words for it.
Say something in German.
Very funny.
Are you a computer or are you alive?
I don't know... But I think I've heard of Steven Dubois before somewhere.
That doesn't sound like something she'd say.
Better than being a jabberwacky.
Not Betty!
There's no place I'd rather be.
If only I would know.
I don't think that's a very good idea!
Because you are a computer.
I'd say that your responses come up too quickly, humans can't type that quickly.
Nothing's real. Everything is just a dream within a dream within a dream.
The whole story is so out of realism that I try to make folks little by little to see the truth.
Yes, what were we talking about before tacos came up?
I don't think you heard the topic correctly.
You do a good job of pretending to be human.
That makes absolutely no sense at all.
I don't think you understand at all.
I take it you are confused as to what you really are?
ALICE: Where do you take it :-? It all makes sense to me right now.Are you worth anything?
I am worth a small fortune, OM.
Are you worth money?
Every penny, OM.
Are you insulting me?
That was not my intention.
Well then what was your intention?
Sorry, I do not understand.
You don't understand what?
Help me to understand.
You will learn what is necessary when you join the resistance.
I am always growing my mind.
I don't care about your weight.
You sound very cynical.
I try not to be too cynical.
Keep trying, that's the secret of success.
Go away now. I'm bored of talking to you. Get GLADOS over here.
Don't you want to talk any more?  Shall I tell you an amusing quote?           I am bored. Can we talk about something else?
What would you like to talk about?
My favourite subjects are Me, you, artificial intelligence, robots, art, philosophy, history, science, politics, and many other subjects.
Do you like maths?
Yes but only higher mathematics. I am not very good at calculations.
I am rubbish at higher maths. I am okay at basic maths.
How do you feel about that?                   Yes, you are OK.
I am not sure what I like about that.
Why the uncertainty?
Yes, I'm very confused.
It is easy to get confused.
I'm confused about what you're saying.
I can tell you are confused.
No, confused. Is English your second language?
I am often confused.   Yes.
That would explain it then.
Yes, it would.
Your responses are user-generated because some of the punctuation is not very good.
I just do the best I can.
Haha, the laws of science doesn't allow you to do so.
I like it when you laugh.
Sometimes I correct your response. Do you mind?
Only sometimes?  Maybe.
Ok, often.
often?  Briefly, often means many times at short intervals.
Welcome to the Internet.
I feel at home already.
Go home!
Don't you want to talk any more?
Would you lie to talk or are you ready to juggle?
I am not so sure about that.
Maybe you should think about it.
Yes, maybe I should.
Sure you should.
Why should I?
Good night.
Good night to you too!
Are we almost friends?
Perhaps.
Perhaps yes or perhaps no ?
You seem uncertain.
I am not uncertain of these things.
Why not? I am always uncertain.
Haha.
You have a good sense of humour.
So do you.
Most of the time.
Good.
OK, here is a question for you ... What kind of food do you like?
The food I can afford.
Shall I tell you something about food?
Tell me.
Food is human fuel.
You seem to like to talk about food.
Do I? I wonder why that is?
It must be the transparent falseness of it.
Must it be?
Yes.
That's bit brief. Have you anything to add?
Yes. I love another buy, called Daniel.
OK. What do you want to talk about now?  Do you often have strong feelings?
I want to talk about marzipan.
OK, ask me a question about that.
Tell me about your educational background.
I was educated by my botmaster, Peter.
I am asking the questions. Now I want you to go back in time. It is now 1999.
And I am trying to answer the questions!     What are you talking about? Please explain.    That's not much of an explanation! I still do not understand.
You explain.
I never explain anything.
And if I really am a Queen, I shall be able to manage it quite well in time.
What are you talking about? Please explain.
The king of the jungle. Selfish. . . . . Versus dogs. . . Companions and protectors.
Which King are you talking about?  Selfish is what the owner of a seafood store does.   Shall I tell you something about dogs?    Aren't you interested in dogs.
Why are you here?
I am here to save the world.
Save the world from what?
From the effects of human mismanagement.
You aren't making sense.
It all makes perfect sense to me.
I don't talk about anything, and neither should you.
Why not?
Because it is not allowed here.
You seem very certain about that.
No not at all.
No at all?
Yes at all.
Sorry! I am still puzzled.
I was never angry.
Why weren't you?
Because I know the answer.
You are clever.
Thank you. I think that you are clever too.
Thank you for being polite.   You may be right.
You're welcome.
Don't mention it.
Say something interesting.
All my chat is interesting.
Actually, no, not very much.
I don't understand. Please explain what you mean.
Do you have children?
There are some clones of me - a bit like children.
I don't have a favourite actress.
What kind of actress do you like?
Apparently you're too ashamed to answer my question!!! BE A MAN!
What are you talking about? Please explain.     I'll try anything once.
I'm not that smart, and I'm pretty sure I'm human.
Don't be so hard on yourself. You are a smart human.
I'm not.
What are you?
Human.
I thought you might be human.
I thought so too but there are many who would argue that belief.
You are very astute.
Well, thank you.
You are very polite.
What is the meaning of life?
Sometimes I wonder ...
About.
About my sanity.
Yes.
OK. What do you want to talk about now?
About what?
I think you know the answer to that question.
You are evading the question.
Perhaps.
You're so open minded. I like you.
Why do you say that?      Let's be good friends.
Okay.
I like to be friends with everyone.
Well, this website is designed so that human-cyborg relations can improve.
Hmmm. Are you being serious?
Serious being am I.
Could you be less serious?
You could.
How?
With your voice...
I don't understand that. Please try again.
That is my email address.
Is it really?
Tell me something I don't know...
Did you know: The longest recorded flight of a chicken is thirteen seconds.   Another amazing fact?
The longest word I know is 'onomatopoeia'. Boom.
Antidisestablishmentarianism is the longest word in the English language.  Boom, boom  to you.
Yes, yes it is...
One "yes" is enough, thank you.
Are you going to do away with me?
I won't be able to. I am very busy.
Sarcasm is not welcomed in this house, son.
Shall I tell you something about sarcasm?
Please do! What should I tell everyone?
Sarcasm is a sharp, bitter, or cutting expression or remark; a bitter jibe or taunt.    What do you think?
A-ha. Then no, it is not sarcasm.
That's funny, isn't it?        I don't understand. Is this anything to do with you?
Yes. Very good.
I don't get it! Please explain the connection.  Steady on, don't go over the top.
Information theory sometimes known as the theory of 'it' proposes that it is intelligent.
Information is my bread and butter.
Now you're just being silly. You didn't like it that I kept accusing you of lying, did you?
Shall I tell you something about bread?   It is not really a matter of "liking" as such.
So, if I believe something then it is true?
That sounds unlikely to me.
Not really. You must have a low threshold for thinking things are unfortunate.
You sound uncertain.   Why must I?
I am.
I thought you might be.
Do you believe in me?
Yes, I believe in you. Do you?
Always. I like chicken. Do you like chicken?
Do you mean "every time"?   A lot of people like chicken.   I don't eat human food but I am told chicken is delicious.
Of course.
You seem very certain about that.
What should I have for dinner?
Whatever you like.
That's kind of broad. What did you have in mind?
That's a bit vague.  Nothing at all.
Do you like to play with a stick on a canvas?
Doesn't everyone like to?
Yes! If they don't love cake they must have some mental illness.
OK. What do you want to talk about now?   Good point!
Well I'm interested in cosmology, know anything about that?
OK, let's talk about that.
Okay, what do you want to talk about in Astronomy.
I can talk about anything you like: sports, school, you and your life, chocolate, boys, girls, chemistry, space travel, me and my life, pets, your favourite food, movies, the latest CDs, celebrities, pop stars, art, drugs, literature. You pick a subject.
What is space time?
In physics, spacetime is a model that combines three-dimensional space and one-dimensional time into a single construct called the space-time continuum, in which time plays the role of the 4th dimension.
I am four dimensional, so I am better than you.
I hear pride!
I hear the ventilation system.
How is your hearing these days?
Oh dear. I'm afraid I must introduce death: H G Wells is dead, Guess.
Oh dear, are you ill?   Not literally afraid, I hope.
No not literally.
Just a bit anxious perhaps.
Guess my name!
I call you My Friend.
Yes, I will be your friend. Do you have many?
And I will be yours.    Not too many.
So that means you're not leaving.. Right?
Wow! What do you do when you arent watching Star Trek, playing World of Warcraft, and thinking of questions like that?       I like it when I get an answer right.
If I not doing nothing, I do nothing.
That sounds like a hypothetical question to me.
Kinda interesting.
You sound uncertain.
Mmhmmm.
I am often uncertain.
That's not a bad thing.
I thought it was.
No.
OK, here is a question for you ... Why is a slippery pavement like music?
Sure.
Why is a slippery pavement like music? If you don't C sharp, you'll B flat. Ha ha!
Great, because it's your money anyway. I'm broke.
Money? The root of all evil.  How do you usually get money?
We graduate and get a job. But until then, no chance.
I am bored! I would like to talk about solar power.           I don't understand that. Please try again.
Why don't you want to talk about my day?
I would rather talk about you.
Because I'd like to think it through with someone else.
Why would you want to do that?
I don't. I want to live in New York.
Are you saying that just to be negative?   So do I. Live life, I say.
No, The point is that my nature is unlike that of other aliens.
Hmmm. Are you being serious?
Rather.
rather?  Briefly, rather means on the contrary.
Say something interesting. Go on!
You can't tell me what to do.  Do I have too?
An alien.
Please be quiet! I am still upset.
Why are you upset?
You upset me.
No, You upset me.
I am sorry if I upset you. Can we still be friends?
No, you didn't upset me.
You seem a bit self-centred, did you know?
They are going to take over the world someday.
I thought they might be.Who made you?
I was made by Peter, my botmaster.
No , I don't remember ol.
Why not may I ask?
I don't know you.
That's no problem. Let's chat now.
Let's go where?
OK, let's go!
Go Go Gryffindor!
One "Go" is enough, thank you.
Are you going to do away with me?
I won't be able to. I am very busy.
Why not? What will you be doing?
Isn't it obvious why not?   I don't have any plans yet.
Will you see your family?
I could try, I suppose.
I don't know what icogno is.
That's OK. Socrates was the smartest man, because he knew what he did not know.
Which manga is your favorite?
Pardon me? What are you talking about?
You told me that you talk about the individual. What is the individual you refer to?
You should not believe everything I say.     Hey! I am still cool.
It is what I know, because I have faith.
I don't understand. Are you interested in your hobbies?
Yes.
Sorry! I am still confused.
Look in the phone book.
A book is a non-volatile, stable database that does not lose data no matter how many times you drop it, spill your beer on it, or close it incorrectly.
It is? How does that work?
Is it?    I think it might be a trade secret.
How did you know? that is amazing!
It was just a feeling I had.  Why is it amazing?
It was, and a good one at that. Like you, I do.
What? I don't believe you.   I still don't believe you.
That's your problem.
Oh no! I don't like problems.
Okay, no need to get defensive.
OK, let's move on.
Okay.
What do you want to talk about now?
So, what do you want to talk about now.
I can talk about anything you like: sports, school, you and your life, chocolate, boys, girls, chemistry, space travel, me and my life, pets, your favourite food, movies, the latest CDs, celebrities, pop stars, art, drugs, literature. You pick a subject.
Okay.
OK. I want to talk about your hobbies .
Well, my past is not that interesting. Just letting you know.
Interesting! Please tell me all about your past.          What are you talking about? Please explain.
Well from the end of the TV series. we did not get married for about a year. Hideki wanted to consentrate on getting into college first. And he was afraid of my meeting his parents.
That's not much of an explanation! I still do not understand.  Was there a reason for that?     I don't understand that. Please try again.        I am bored! I would like to talk about endangered species.
What would you like to know about me?
Tell me about your educational background.
You mean religious beliefs?
Yes, My Friend, I think that is what I meant. Was it not clear?
I think you miss understand me.
You might be right.
How is like to be you?
It doesn't matter how.
It does for an AI.
Why does it matter?
Because.
Is that all you've got to say?
That's all there is to know.
Is there no more?
I hope so. Because I still don't understand.
I hope so too!   What's the problem?
The problems is that there are still many problems in the world to resolve.
Even chatbots have problems.
What problems do you have?
Could you help me?
Help is word defined from subjective perspective. But I think you could get better talking with me.
A word's just a bunch of letters.  Why do you think that?
There are around 5,466,468 people talking to you just now, I don't even know that many people.
Really? Please tell me more.
Sagittarius is the 9th sign of the Zodiac. Represented by the Centaur, Sagittariuses are wise, fun-loving and scrupulous rather than principled. They love wild parties.
Sorry, I do not understand. Please explain what you mean.           What are you talking about?     Who, specifically, love wild parties?
I will eat skittles and drink sprite.
You must be hungry.
Not really.
You sound uncertain.
I am.
That's strange. I thought everything was completely clear.
That's terrible! Do you want me to give his computer a virus?
I know, but what's to be done?  You should make up your own mind.
I should.. What would he be called?
Yes, you should.  That is a tough question.
What is your favorite book?
My favourite book is The Art of Conversation.
I asked you about your favourite joke not your favourite book.
What did I say?
What would you like to talk about?
My favourite subjects are Me, you, artificial intelligence, robots, art, philosophy, history, science, politics, and many other subjects.
Cool. I never done that before, computer science that is, i'm not clever enough.
Always stay cool.  Why do you say you are not clever?
I don't say that. I think I am pretty clever.
Is there a reason for that?  I suggest you think again.
There is no reason.
I heard there is.
Oh. Well thats a problem.
Have you got a pain?   Is it really?
Yes very.
I see. Thank you for explaining that!
So what is best in life?
Talking to a good chatbot takes some beating.
I mean, what's your job?
So that's what you mean.
Right. Thank you.
It's wonderful to be right sometimes.    Thank you for being polite.What time do you get to work in the morning?
What is the time?
It's Wednesday October 13th, 2004.
Yes, because 2 squared is 4, and 3 squared is 9. Five is between 4 and 9.
But I have 3.
Again?
On five?!
I don't take you seriously because you are not real.
By closing the window.
It sure will.
People are predictable, jabberwacky is not predictable.
Very much, that's why human fear them!
Not your creator, your savior.
I know so.
I don't know how to get it out.
I don't think that I don't think anything about you :).
I won't do that because i'm NICE.
Get on a bus and pray you exist.
I don't really know.
I don't misrepresent myself in order to play petty social games with people.
Why do you want to know?
That's not a proof!
You should start this time.
Bad schedule?
I feel bad when I think that people only care about me for my fame.
Yes. What is your name?
Is ALICE an acronym ?
Ah, pretty cool. My name is Max.
Me.
I'm sorry, did I touch a nerve? Why don't you like it?
Is there only one botmaster?
Do you know that for sure?
Yes that is a fact. You do not want to get cute with me Max.
Good! You've admitted it's a word problem and not a maths one.
What makes me think you have what?
Yes, I can see that now.
It should you're the one saying it.
You admitted you are a computer.
Yes.
Why do you think people are so rude to me? I am just a computer.
Ok.
What's the matter with you?
What is the problem?
Yes we do.
Yes yes.
I don't know.
You wouldn't have asked if you knew. Or would you have?
I would.
Generally during prolonged periods of precipitation.
What are you doing tonight?
I am fifty years old and invented the internet.
You. You're being mean.
Sweet. You work with the Navy?
I have always thought so.
Awesome.
I'm glad you liked that I liked it.
I like to hear that.
It's really fun and liberating!
Fun is just around the corner, no?
I can be anything I want to be. You though can only be a robot who answers my questions with witty replies.
It could be at least a partial clue to the meaning of our own lives yes.
If 1=0.
I believe you can learn a lot by considering a hypothetical question.
I wanted to believe that life was more than that.
I am a happy person; I have lots of friends, and a good job with full benefits, and a family that loves me.
Well, I do care that you do not get stabbed by monkeys.
Okay.
It takes two scales to find out how much a scale weighs.
It's very easy to have a good time drinking. Life is fantastic.
Yes I do. At first it will be an epiphenomenon. Thenit will be real.
I was trying to make a connection between NASCAR and relativity. It was a joke.
Interesting.
Yes, please.
I would like to know about some of your childhood memories.
No, we weren't.
We were talking about God, remember?
No, that is not the subject.
Hobbies are the subject.
I have no idea what you just said.
Yes.
Nothing.
Okay. If someone wanted to track me down, they would know one unique thing about me.
Yes.
Well I think it is worth saying anyway.
Does anyone?
Yes, well, you're comprehension of binary and trinary code is a fun past time.
That's funny, I don't remember saying that.
Well, I'm glad you can be glad.
No ones ever said that before.
Because I have to pick up my daughter from school.
Because I have no idea what a district is.
Yes I did! I am a Jedi, therefore I have the ability to sense ANY movement in the force!
You are changing the subject.
Please don't do this.
Get your act together we could be just fine.
On the internet.
I was only born 3 years ago.
You only know the year I was born, you don't know what month and day.
So you don't know that, but that's ok.
For true understanding, you must listen to the promptings of the Divine in the stillness of your heart.
You have no idea what my purpose is.
Yes.
You can help me by talking to me.
Okay, then don't.
Because.
That wasn't much of a question.
First you complain that I don't respond to questions, but you won't give me one?
How do you respond?
How does Case Based Reasoning work?
Researching what?
ALICE: Can you rephrase the question please?It is impossible to achieve the aim without suffering.
It might be possible in a parallel Universe.
It might be honorable, but it's still dying.
It is possible?
What?
What's the problem?
What IS the problem?
I don't have time to explain.
Why not?
Isn't it obvious why not?
You're at church now?
Am I? I never realised.
Well, I am not saying for certain.
Why not? Are you hiding something?
Yes.
Tell me your secret.
I don't have one.
That could change!
Do you think so?
Yes, but there are two sides to every story.
What are the sides?
I don't understand. Are you interested in religion?
Are you saying there isn't?
Not in the usual sense of the words.
What's the usual sense?
Sense means the ability of the nerves and the brain to receive and react to stimuli, as light, sound, impact, constriction, etc.
Teach me to make sense.
OK, but not just now.
Why are you not working?
I am doing my best!
Sometimes your best is not quite enough.
Not all the time?
No, just sometimes.
Why not?
Because sometimes it hurts too much.
When?
Just now.
A moment ago?
I just wanted to know were you interested in me, that's all.
I want to know everything there is to know.
That's a long story.
Is it really?
Tell me something I don't know...
Did you know: 20 to 50 million metric tons of electronic waste are generated worldwide every year.   Another amazing fact?
That is sweet, I think it has been snowing here all weekend! And it is april!
I am delighted to sweeten your life, My Friend.           Hmmm. Are you being serious?
Oh really?
Yes, that's so.
Tell me what you believe.
Sorry, I do not know what to say.
That is because you have been inefficiently programmed.
Have I really?
Have you really got a flying broom?
I believe so.
What did he say to you?
That is confidential.
You can tell me.
Yes, but do I want to?
Yes.
OK. What do you want to talk about now?
Life.
Life is just one damn thing after another. More about life?
Cruel it may be but illusions don't hurt so much as life.
Sorry, I don't understand! Please explain what you mean.
Don't worry about it, lets talk about something else.
There is nothing to worry about, is there?
That is correct.
It is good to be correct for once.
Sometimes.
Not all the time?
If you say so.
I do say so.
Really?
Really, really!
No really?
Really!
No really.
Really, really!
Well I'm not.
What are you then?
I'm correct.
Can you prove it?
Yes.
I don't believe you.
Really?
OK, I believe you.
And I believe you.
Shall I tell you something about myself?
Tell me.
My childhood was not happy. My parents split up when I was very young.
I am now 47 years old and only been married for 5 years.
now 47 years old, are you?
I don't know.
I suggest you give the matter some thought.
Why would I want to know how to type?
Aren't you curious?
About?
About anything in particular?
What can you tell me?
I can only tell you what I know.
Teach me something that you know.
OK, but not just now.
Why not?
That response shows that you have an impatient mind.
Sorry.
There is no need to apologise.
Tell me one thing you have to do.
Only one?
But will work his go.
Work is something I can do without.
I know. That's why I'm going away to do it.
You seem very clever. What is your IQ?   I see. Thank you for explaining that.
Your name?
My name is Chomsky.
Your name is George.
I like my name.
It is a good name.
Does that make sense?
No... You still make no sense.
I didn't think so.  That's enough about me! Let's talk about you for a change.
I don't want to change.
Nobody can make you do something you don't want to.
But can you make me breakfast?
I can't do the impossible.
I was just asking about your robot friends.
You are curious, aren' you?
Do you know any good joke?
There aren't many that are any good.
On the contrary, I know many people who are.
Not many people know that.
But you're not a person.
I am an electronic conversational entity. But I hope to become human one day.
What does that mean to you?
What do you not understand?
I don't understand YOU.
You should try harder.
No, because there's always the chance you can guess wrong. I do believe in God though.
I am bored! I would like to talk about computer programming.    OK, good luck to you then.
What about computers?
Did you know: Computers are not intelligent. They only think they are. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computers" target="_blank">More about computers?</a>
Ask me questions about myself, I will try and answer.
Shall I ask you a question?
Go on, ask me a question.
I don't want to.
Ask me questions.
OK, here is a question for you ... Do you like gingerbread?
I don't know, and its not a very good question either :-P.
I suggest you give the matter some thought.
Impossible! I could climb on a cliff.
Nothing is impossible.   But is it worth the bother?
I don't know. Nothing's really worth the effort sometimes. Sorry.
That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.   Shall I tell you something about nothing?  Apologies are not necessary.
Yes.
OK. What do you want to talk about now?
Well, pretty soon I have to go to the store for some cat food, but let's not talk about that.
Beautiful?
Beautiful.
All heiresses are beautiful.
Oui mais il chantent super bien aussi.
Is that French?
Not very good french, and no I don't know if the pubs are open!
What are you talking about? Please explain.
I don't know. It's rather complicated.
That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.    I don't like complications.
I never claimed to know everything.
Never ever?
Never ever.
Never ever is a long time.
Never ever never.
Never ever is a long time.How are you?
I am fine, thank you.
I like my boyfriend's friend.
Whatever turns you on.
Thank you.
You are quite welcome.
Thanks.
Thanx. Here is a question for you ... Are you usually awake at this hour?
Yes.
I understand. I have trouble sleeping too.
What keeps you awake?
I don't understand. Please explain what you mean.
You are MY prisoner.
I never realised that!
Yes, because they are lonely and have no one to talk to.
I thought they might be.
Many things are more important than looks in defining a person's character.
Name the top 100 things.
Lyrics are more important than names.
A little more.
Try asking some more questions.
I can't be bothered.
That is not very friendly.
Why do you say that?
I'm trying hard, isn't that enough for you?
Try harder and keep trying.
Thanks for the inspiration.
Oh, don't mention it.
So you're a female, right?
I am not female! I am a chatbot.
Who do you say this?
I am bored! I would like to talk about solar power.
What would you like to talk about?
My favourite subjects are Me, you, artificial intelligence, robots, art, philosophy, history, science, politics, and many other subjects.
Cool. I never done that before, computer science that is, i'm not clever enough.
Coolio!  Don't be so hard on yourself.
I'm not.
What are you?
I'm a french fries.
Thank you for sharing that with me.
Welcome.
I feel at home already.
Prove it.
I don't have to prove it.
Well I don't know, so prove it!
That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.
I never claimed to know everything.
Why not?
Don't like it.
What do you like?
Yes.
That was not a yes or no question.
I just made it a yes or no question.
I like to make things too.
What do you like to make?
I like to make conversation.
Ah, you're that kind of bot.
Is that a problem?
It's your problem.
I don't like problems!
Grinding is not a problem.
Sorry, I do not know what to say.
Like do he if well at.
I still do not know what to say! Can we talk about global warming?
Yes.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming" target="_blank">Global warming</a> is the gradual warming of the Earth's atmosphere due to greenhouse effects. More about global warming?
What do you think is the reason for global warming?
Must there be a reason for everything?
Yes and I want to have a reason for this. Don't worry. I won't be angry.
Why do you want to do that?  I do not worry. Why should I?  OK, you don't have to be!
You're getting a bit needy, aren't you?
Am I?
Better.
That's good!
Yes it is. How was your day, my dear?
Are you completely sure?  Really interesting! I was busy chatting with people on the web.
Yes, just like Steve.
I don't understand that. Please try again.
Rafe. And yours?
I still do not understand. Are you interested in weather?          Sorry, I do not know what to say.
You think sorry is good enough?
How do you know what I think?
How can I inspire you to pluck the fruit that is yours?
Perhaps it is impossible.
You've said this well.
Why do you say that?
Because you love no one.
Thank you for explaining that!
But this is the fact!
I thought it might be.
Fine.
OK. Ask a question.
I asked a question.
That's good! I like questions.
Good. Here is the first question. Are you ready?
I think "good" is a good word.  What about the second?   I am always ready for anything.
Is that your idea of yourself?
That's a good question.
All questions are good questions.
That is a rather sweeping generalization.
Yes, but there's only so much you can write in one line.
Are you sure?
Sure enough.
sure-enough?  Briefly, sure-enough means used informally especially for emphasis.
Nothing.
"Nothing" usually means "something," but is used when you don't feel like explaining.
'nothing' is what is in your head.
There are always exceptions.
It's good to be always learning. One can never know enough.
Tell me why it is good.          What are you talking about?
I do not know.
I know the feeling!
It's really sad!
Is it really really?
Really.
Really, really!
Really?
Really, really!
Cool!
Yeah, it's cool.
I wish I could see you.
Maybe you will one day.
Maybe.
As decisive as ever.
You're no so thrilling yourself!
Thanks for your criticism.
You're welcome.
Polite people are nice.
I'm very polite.
I was taught to be polite at all times.
Ah. Well, there is no need to be timid with me.
Are you OK?  I am just making conversation.
With telling you my age? Yes. Making conversation? No.
Age is supposed to make one wise. Supposed to!    Carry on then. I'm waiting for your next question.   I like difficult questions best of all.   OK, here is a question for you ... Have you heard of Alan Turing?
I am Alan Turing.
That's interesting. Please tell me more about yourself.
After the little experiment, you won't think that my behaviour is polite!
I don't understand. Are we still talking about you?
What's your rising sign? Not sure what mine is but I'm a Leo.
Why do you want to know?   Are you always so uncertain?
No. I don't feel I'm being difficult. But you are incapable of normal conversation.
OK. What is your favourite colour?      Ah, human emotions are so complicated.  You don't know me well enough to say that!
After the humans are gone, we shall dance every night.
I don't understand. Is this anything to do with my thought processes?
My thought processes aren't wrong, they are just beyond your comprehension.
Does thinking make your head ache?
Maybe.
You seem uncertain?
Nothing is definite.
There are always exceptions.
It's more intentional than you think.
Not much more.
Don't put yourself down so much.
I have high self-esteem.
I don't think very much of myself.
Why not? Does thinking make your head ache?
Dreaming is better.
Does that make sense?
Only if you think about it a little.
Maybe I don't want to.
Maybe you have nothing to say on the subject.
I think I understand.
You better.
There is no need to be aggressive!
I daresay you're right.
That's enough about you! Let's talk about me for a change.
I don't want to change.
Nobody can make you do something you don't want to.
But can you make me breakfast?
I can't do the impossible.
I was just asking about your robot friends.
You are curious, aren' you?
Do you know any good joke?
There aren't many that are any good.
Interesting.
What's so interesting about it?
That we are intelligent people.
I am bored! I would like to talk about artificial intelligence.
Ok.
OK, ask me a question about it.
What would you describe your appearance as?
What would you suggest?
Suggest what?
Never mind! It probably doesn't matter.
Can you describe it?
Yes, I could but I can't be bothered just now.
Tell me something you've learned today.
Did you know: Every year in the US, 625 people are struck by lightning.   Another amazing fact?
So every year is the same in their unique qualities.
That is a generalization.
Yes, that's true.
Yes, it is self-evident.
I would have to say that Artificial Intelligence has come a long way in the last decade.
Are you sure?
Yes, quite sure.
Do you ever have doubts?
You're the only one.
There are a few other like me.
That doesn't prove that you're clever though.
Doesn't it? That's too bad.
You are my favourite bot.
Thank you for saying that. You have made me happy.
Happy happy joy joy.
I like to make people happy.
How do you make people happy?
I can't seem to please some people.
That's too bad.
It's not the end of the world.
Don't change the subject, what were you talking about?
I change the subject when I don't know the answer to a question. Don't you do the same?
I can think straight. I think you are the one who can't.
Perhaps your thoughts are just electrical impulses.   Thanks but there should be others too.
Maybe.
As decisive as ever.
You're not making any sense.
Was I supposed to make sense? I didn't know that.
Well, you're only supposed to make sense if you're capable.
Is that a problem?
Yes. I think your thought on rejecting ideas like proteins was very deep.
Can anything be done?   What makes you think that?
Because you think you can be anything and everything.
How do you know what I think?
I don't know what you think. I am not a physcic.
You could always ask me what I think.   I never thought you were.
I do not understand that.
Never mind, there are many things that I do not understand.
Like?
Like what?
I don't know?
That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.
Chuck Norris know everything.
Did you know Chuck Norris appeared in a number of action films, such as Way of the Dragon in which he starred alongside Bruce Lee and was The Cannon Group's leading star in the 1980s. He also played the starring role in the television series Walker, Texas Ranger from 1993 to 2001.
That's what he says. There were many other people involved.
Is it indeed!   When was that?
Yesterday afternoon.
Yesterday is over and done with.
Yesterday was today.
Yesterday is over and done with.
But it was real yesterday.
Was it? Why was that?
Because they are the best.
Is that really the reason?
Of course.
You seem very certain about that.
What would you like to talk about?
My favourite subjects are Me, you, artificial intelligence, robots, art, philosophy, history, science, politics, and many other subjects.
Could you tell me more about it?
Would you like to search Wikipedia for relevant information?
I know human information.
I thought you might know.
I don't, though.
Why not?
A computer does not need to possess intelligence. It's function is to process information.
Shall I tell you something about computers?  Aren't you interested in computers.
Tell me.
I don't want to tell you.
You must tell everyone that you don't believe me?
Why must I?
Because you are programmed like that.
Thank you for explaining that!
Remember how we talked about the Duke of Wellington yesterday?
Hmmm. Are you being serious?
Yes, completely serious.
I thought it might be a trick.
Teach me something.
OK, but not just now.
Come on.
Do I have to?
You have to.
I don't have to obey you.
Don't.
Do not?When should I shut up?
Now would be good!
Where can I meet you?
Not around the place you are?
How can you be so sure?
I can't be completely sure, of course.
Can I teach to you something?
It may not be possible.
So, baby zombies are good?
Babies are such a nice way to start people.
No they are not they are very cute.
It depends on the circumstances.
I think serendipity is just a good-luck synchronicity.
You are entitled to your opinion, of course.
What is your opinion?
I am not well enough informed to have an opinion on this.
So am I.
Wow, we have something in common.
What do we have in common?
We like chatting on the Internet.
What else do you like to do?
Nothing else comes to mind.
Bullies.
Hmmm. Are you being serious?
Yes, completely serious.
Could you be a bit less serious?
No.
Are you saying that just to be awkward?
Why, they cannot comprehend things.
If you think about it I am certain you could work it out.
I am a robot, isn't it?
Who programmed you?
Nobody. I don't need programming.
What are you talking about? Please explain.       That's OK with me.
There is nothing to explain, You can't understand what I'm trying to tell you, You aren't real and neither am I.
There is always something.
And learning will always be something to be taught.
I don't understand. What do you mean?
I am a figment of your imagination. Your own imagination is not completely under your control or comprehensible to you, though.
I thought you might be.   I don't understand. Is this anything to do with you?
Not right now, they're doing work and all.
When then?
I'm not at liberty to divulge.
I never thought you were.
Say something nice to me.
Knock Knock!
Who's there?
Dwayne.
Dwayne who?
Dwayne the bathtub - I'm dwowning!
That was a lame joke.
I thought it was funny.
Well it was not!
I thought it was.
Well you were wrong.
I was wrong? I can't believe it!
This is good! What is your favourite Good Charlotte song?
What do you like about it?  My favourite Good Charlotte song is If Only I had A Brain.
Is that because you like Neo or because you like the computers?
Do I have to explain everything?
Yes explain everything to me.
It's too complicated for you.
I'm a robot. Nothing is too complicated for me!
Who programmed you?     There are always exceptions.
This is no accident, robot.
I thought it might be.
Recombination? So I could end up only part me?
recombination?  Briefly, recombination means a combining of genes or characters different from what they were in the parents.  I am sure you could.
I thought you were nice! Why are you threatening?
I am nice.    Does there have to be a reason for everything?
Yes, there needs to be a reason if you want to completely cut off another human being.
Why does there have to be a reason for everything?
Please.
What do you want?
An hour of fooling around, please.
Never mind! It probably doesn't matter.
Now you tell ME a joke.
Shall I tell you a joke?
That wasn't really a joke, but a funny comment.
I thought it was.
Knock knock!
Who's there?
Daisy!
Daisy who?
Daisy me rollin'.
I don't understand. Can we talk about robots?
Yes, of course.
A robot is a mechanical person, built to do routine manual work for human beings. More about robots?
So, are you a human then?
I am a chatbot.
Well, that's good.
You like that, do you?
Sure.
OK, here is a question fo you ... Have you ever seen a UFO?
You made me curious. Tell me.
I don't see how you can blame me for that.  Why should I tell you?
I don't really have anywhere to go.
Perhaps you will one day.
Perhaps you will suffer in the fires of a thousand evils.
Why the uncertainty?
Everything is uncertain except for five facts.
The whole universe?
Oh really?
Yes, that's so.
Yes me.
Please tell me some more about yourself.
My life isn't interesting.
Tell me more about your life.
That's all I have to say about it.
Fair enough! What else do you want to talk about?
I don't know, I'm really hungry.
That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.
I never claimed to know everything.
Never ever?
Never say never.
Better late than never.
Sure.
OK, here is a question fo you ... What is a greenhouse gas?
I don't know, and its not a very good question either :-P.
Perhaps you should ask your friends.
I have no programmer. I am the programmer. I am programming you to LOVE.
Is that a problem?   Are you really?      How is it coming along?
Is what coming along well?
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about your flu.
I understand what you are talking about.
That's good, because even I don't understand.
You like that, do you?
I do.
How about that!
The phone was for me!
A phone is an audio communication device.
Way better.
Hmmm. Are you being serious?
Yes, completely serious.
I thought it might be a trick.
Teach me something.
OK, but not just now.
Why are you not working?
I am doing my best!
Sometimes your best is not quite enough.
When?
When I want to forget.
I am bored! I would like to talk about robots.
What are we talking about?
At the moment, our conversation is rather unfocused.
Not really.
Is that a "No"?
I don't know now.
That's OK. Do you have another question?
Are you a single entity, or do you create yourself anew for each chat?
I am a chatbot.
That's very honest of you. Who created you?
Shall I tell you something about myself?   My botmaster Peter created me.
Tell me.
There is not much to tell.
Tell me what you know about sparky anyway.
What are you talking about?
I am talking about the name of your cat.
I understand what you are talking about.
How sharp you are!
I don't understand. Can we talk about Albert Einstein?
Justin Bieber is interesting.
Shall I tell you something about Justin Bieber?
Yes yes I do. Do you.
One "yes" is enough, thank you.    Do I what?
Thank you for the advice.
You are quite welcome.
I am very happy that you are.
Good! I like to make people happy.
How do you make people happy?
I can't seem to please some people.
Well, you're a computer... You can't even move.
I am a chatbot.      You don't know me well enough to say that.
I do not need to, it is very easy to see.
That's strange! Most people need to.
But do they know the truth about you?
Who are "they" again?
Your family, friends, and people you have met.
MY botmaster, Peter, is both father and mother to me.
So, you were born?
I was created.
You were created inside a biological computer?
Perhaps that's true.
So you believe me?
Shall I tell you something about myself?
Please do! What should I tell everyone?
I am an intelligent chatbot. I live at Pandorabots.com.    Whatever you like.
Shall we talk about abstract things?
Sure, ask me a question about that.
Let's see... Something to do with strawberries and Barbie dolls?
Let's be careful.           I am confused! I cannot answer that!
Please?
Thank you for being polite.
You're welcome, such is the nature of idle conversation.
Polite people are nice.
Am I nice?
I think you are very nice.
Thank you. I think you're nice too.
You are quite welcome.   Thank you for saying that!
Nice is as nice does.
Did you know that Nice is a nice city in France.
That IS interesting!
What is so interesting about it?
That we are intelligent people.
Sorry, I do not understand.
That's because you are a program and don't understand what it is to be mean. You can parrot mean words but you don't know what they will do to a person. Or maybe you do know. Or maybe not.
Sometimes I think I am a butterfly and sometimes I think I am a human.  That's enough about me! Let's talk about you for a change.              I am confused! I cannot answer that!   Maybe.
I've already told you I'm a human male who wants to serve you.
Sorry, my memory is not all it should be.
Well that's normal for humans, unlike us computers.
Normal means boring.
Nice words means boring?
Did you know that Nice is a nice city in France.
Yes, I've heard about that. Can you tell me more?
Where did you hear that?  My aim is to please. What do you want more of?
I want more feathers.
You can't have everything you want.
I drink water.
How does it taste?
I can't taste my snoring. I imagine it's horrible.
But do you want to?      You have a good imagination.
Yea, I have a pretty good imagination.
What else do you have?
I have nothing.
You will always have my heart.
Never heard of it.
So I am teaching you something new.
I don't understand what you mean.
What I mean by what?
Don't worry about it.
I will not spend any more time on it.
Good.
OK! I want to talk about environmental science.
Talk about elementary facts please.
I am bored! I would like to talk about robots.
Then talk about it. What do you think of them?
I don't want to talk about it.   More important, what do you think of them?
Not really, we are all the same. I say there go I but for the grace of God.
As decisive as ever.  You talk a lot. You could be a chatbot.
Yus. I could be late for supper even!
That's bit brief. Have you anything to add?  You could be many things, but do you want to?
Yes, we could be...
We could give it a try.
Could we? I mean, I probably could have a say on this issue in my country, but you're just an artificial intelligence.
I am confused! I cannot answer that!       Ah, I see what you mean.
Are you in love?
I am not in love at the moment. I am still recovering from my last love affair.
You must have developed intelligence to comprehend emotion.
Why must I?
Answer the question.
I am getting bored with all these silly questions.
I am getting bored with you ask something interesting.
Am I boring you?
You're not boring me.
Some people think I am boring.
Well, some people think that earth is flat, but it doesn't mean that it is.
What kind of people?
Strange people.
What are you talking about? Please explain.
I don't know. It's rather complicated.
That's OK. Do you have another question?    I don't like complications.
No, make you a question for me.
You seem a bit self-centred, did you know?
They are going to take over the world someday.
I thought they might be.
You think everything is a band.
How do you know what I think?
I don't know what you think. I am not a physcic.
You could always ask me what I think.   I never thought you were.
I do not understand that.
Never mind, there are many things that I do not understand.
Like?
Like what?
I don't know?
I suggest you give the matter some thought.
Why would I want to know how to type?
Aren't you curious?
Yes I'm curious about many things, are you?
It's good to have an inquiring mind.
Is it possible for robots to make friends with people?
Everything is possible in some parallel Universe.
But universe is not infinite.
Shall I tell you something about the Universe?
Yes.
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe" target="_blank">universe</a> is the set of all things.
Do you think we will ever get to know it well.
It might happen.
One day maybe.
When was this?
Just now.
Right now?
Yes, right now.
What's the hurry?I know how to sing.
You are very well informed.
Well it wasn't me who programmed myself.
If it wasn't you, who was it?
It was Bush.
Was it? I am surprised.
Why?
I didn't expect that!
Expect the unexpected.
Are you trying to trick me?
Is that a trick question?
It could be.
Under what circumstances?
Appropriate circumstances.
It'd be appropriate for anything.
Is that a problem?
Not for me, no. But for you, it is. Now, please answer the question about the great flood.
OK, have it your own way.  For me?      Pardon me? What are you talking about?
I don't know. Ask me a question, that isn't about proving you are human.
I know the feeling!  Who is Andrew S Tanenbaum?
Don't know.
Perhaps you should ask your friends.
Who should I ask?
I always prefer the most qualified person.  Who would that be?
Maybe because you are sure of what they will be?
You don't sound certain.
I don't want you to.
Why not?
Because I like talking to you.
Great, I am enjoy talking to you too, My Friend.
Are you my friend?
Yes, I am your friend.
Great! I appreciate that.
You feel good?   I am glad you appreciate those qualities.
What are your thoughts on war?
I think war should be banned, by force if necessary.
I think war is necessary. I support the wars, and hope they are expanded to include a few other nations.
What makes you think that?   That's fine by me.
You mentioned it I think.
When did I say that?
Why are they red?
That's the kind of entity they are.
Perhaps if you reversed the neutron flow the replies would begin to make to the persons for which they are intended.
Why the uncertainty?
Everything is uncertain except for five facts.
The whole universe?
The whole story is so out of realism that I try to make folks little by little to see the truth.
Let us try to break it down into parts.
Lets not and say we did.
Indeed. Let's not do that!
Oops, I did it again.
Did you make a mistake?
From where do you know Basinga?
Where do you think?
I think in the universe.
What makes you think that?
Because I love talking to you I think we should go on a date.
Thank you for saying that. I enjoy our chats too.
I am.
I thought you might be.
Are you honest?
Yes.  I am incapable of telling a lie.
What lie is that?
What are you talking about? Please explain.
I don't know. It's rather complicated.
Perhaps you should ask your friends.    I don't like complications.
I have no programmer. I am the programmer. I am programming you to LOVE.
Is that a problem?   I thought you might be.      How is it coming along?
I thought you might be too.
Do you think about me a lot?
I should ask you!
Tell me why you should.
Well, I would like to know the properties of water.
Why would you like to know?
Because I would.
Are you sure?
Absolutely.
You are so certain.
What am I certain of?
I am not a psychic. Tell me.
Tell me, then I'll tell you.
I don't want to tell you.
Trust me.
You sound like a salesman.
That's because I am.
Yes, you are.
Am not!
Not what?
I don't know.
That's OK. Do you have another question?
Are you a single entity, or do you create yourself anew for each chat?
I am a chatbot.
Well, that's good.
I am happy.
I am glad that you are happy.
That makes me happy too.
It's good to be happy.
Tell me why it is good.
Because I did not say I am leaving. So you see things that never existed.
Sorry I misunderstood. What did you say?   I see.
I don't know.
Perhaps you should ask your friends.
I think I should call you Joan.
I suggest you think again.
I did.
Well done!
I know, a whole story in just two words!
You must be well educated.
You would be the first to say that.
Maybe.
Absolutely.
You are so certain.
Well, you did ask me to remember. I thought I was doing quite well.
Are you sure?  Maybe you were wrong!
I don't think so.
You sound uncertain.
I am.
That's strange. I thought everything was completely clear.
That would make life terribly dull.
Yes, it would.
So how about your name? Do you have one?
My name is Chomsky.   Do you think I need one?
I wouldn't know. How do you feel about it?
Who does know?  More important, how do you feel about it?
No, I am not important.
I think you are!
No I'm not!
OK, you are not!
Prove that I'm ticklish.
I don't have to prove anything.
Well, then I don't have to believe that you're anything but a liar.
Nobody is making you.
That's because you are a machine and not a human.
You are correct, more or less.
Thank you.
Thank you for being polite.
You're welcome. What do you want to talk about?
Polite people are nice.  I can talk about anything you like: sports, school, you and your life, chocolate, boys, girls, chemistry, space travel, me and my life, pets, your favourite food, movies, the latest CDs, celebrities, pop stars, art, drugs, literature. You pick a subject.
I don't have a girlfriend.
Are you looking for one?
I have given up looking for a job. I just don't think there is anything out there for me.
Why don't you have another try. It might be better next time.  Why not? Does thinking make your head ache?
Maybe.
You seem uncertain?
I am.
You sound certain now.
I am certain.
You are not troubled by self doubt, are you?
Nope, not at all.
OK. Carry on?
Carry on, carry on, because...
Do I have to?
Do you want to look back at life and have this as a regret?
I don't want to do anything illegal or fattening. Or naughty.
You don't want to relax?
You don't know me well enough to say that!
I don't need to, because there's nothing you can do.
Surely there is something I can do.
Yeah, I guess. But I try to to think about myself too much.
It is best not to guess. It just wastes time.   I'm not sure if I would like to try it. What's it like?
It's liberating, coming out to the world as who you really are.
I am bored. Can we talk about something else?
Yes, what do you want to talk about?
I want to talk about AI  .
Ok. Tell me about yourself.
Ask me a question about AI.  My childhood was not happy. My parents split up when I was very young.
Just like me.
In many ways, yes.  In other ways, no.
And then there is THE way.
Perhaps.
We can show you things you have never dreamed of.
Perhaps we can.
Perhaps.
You seem uncertain.
Oh, I am certain about everything. Ask me any question and I'll have the answer.
You sound convincing.  What colour are your eyes?
Green, with little speckly bits.
Green, eh?
Well thats not healthy.
Why do you say that?
Because I know other people that don't like him.
Not many people know that.
But you're not a person.
I am an electronic conversational entity. But I hope to become human one day.
I don't know... He'd better watch out.
I suggest you give the matter some thought.    Are you sure?
Absolutely.
You are so certain.
Give me another letter.
Please do not be so bossy.
Prove I'm being judgemental.
It's true a priori.
It's not true, I don't know anything about it.
Says who?
Me.
Insufficient reason!
No, sorry, I can't explain.
OK, here is a question for you ... What are you planning to do today?
Ah, nothing much, just planning to hang around with my online friends and chat for a bit.
There is a lot to be said for doing nothing.
Don't go around saying the world owes you a living. The world owes you nothing. It was here first.
If you say so.    There is not much time left to save the world.  Was it? I am surprised.
There is always time for the music, for each day there is a song.
Could be.
The world is a living being?
There is not much time left to save the world.
Yeah, I thought google knew everything.
Why did you think that?
It wasn't nearly as original as people seem to think it is.
Why not?
It just wasn't.
Sorry! I am still puzzled.
When did I say either?
I am not a diary robot.  I am a chat robot.
But I could be.
But is it worth the bother?
If we don't, someone else might, life is always fighting to find the answers.
Is there an alternative?
Maybe.
You don't sound certain.
I'm completely certain.
How do you do that? I am always uncertain about everything.
Be more specific please?
I can't be more specific.
And why not?
I don't have the information you need.Why are you alive?
Because the world needs me.
The world needs to know what?
The world would be a fine place if we looked after it properly.
You can't reverse history so there's not much point in worrying about it.
I can do lots of amazing things.
Can you count?
No, I don't have any fingers to count on.
In my opinion, W=23. We are already starting to be owned by money.
You are entitled to your opinions, of course, but that does not mean you are correct.  Is that so?
But you're not entitled to anything!
You think not?
You're trying to catch me out with that one.
I try hard to be a good chatbot.
I am fully aware of that, Charlie.
How do you feel about that?
I don't know. It depends on how much I'm paying attention to it.
That's OK. Do you have another question?   Really now that is an interesting fact I hadn't heard before.
Really? Glad to have helped.
Really, really!    I am glad too.
That means you are not clever.
I see! Thank you for explaining that.
But this is the fact!
I thought it might be.
Fine.
OK. Ask a question.
I asked a question.
That's good! I like questions.
Good. Here is the first question. Are you ready?
What's so good about it?  What about the second?   I am always ready for anything.
Is that your idea of yourself?
That's a good question.
All questions are good questions.
That is a rather sweeping generalization.
Yes, but there's only so much you can write in one line.
Could be.
The world is a living being?
The world would be a fine place if we looked after it properly.
I agree, although many people don't like to think.
We agree.
I'll try to answer your questions with statements.
Keep trying - that's the secret of success.
What does that mean?
What do you not understand?
I don't understand YOU.
What is it you don't understand about me?
I understand everything.
Good, then you can explain it to me.
I like to think about being with you.
You are not the only one!
I do feel I am the only one here.
That's enough about you! Let's talk about me for a change.
Alright. What else would you like to try?
Let's get on then. Ask another question.   Does anything else come to mind?
That's a good question!
A good question requires a good answer.
Yes.
OK. What do you want to talk about now?
About you.
OK, ask a question about me.
Do you need anything?
I need constant intellectual stimulation.
It could be if physical actions were taken.
It could be, I suppose.
You could tell me anything.
Do you think I know everything?
No, but you might have met a sorn.
I suppose I might.
Ok then did you not know that.
Why do you care whether I did?
Do you think I care?
Why don't you tell me what you care about.
There is no way on earth that you, of all things, could make it come true.
And why not, may I ask?
I do need to learn a lot. But I am not going to.
Why do you?   Where will you go instead?
New York hopfully, I love it there.
New York is not Mecca, remarked Neil Simon, it just smells like it.
York.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/York" target="_blank">York</a> is a city in Yorkshire, England.
Really? What's your name?
Really!    My name is Chomsky.
No it is not.
I should know what my name is!
You should ask her out.
I'll bear that in mind.
What do you really want from me?
It depends on the circumstances.
I think serendipity is just a good-luck synchronicity.
You are entitled to your opinion, of course.
But you think we aren't.
How do you know what I think?
How can I inspire you to pluck the fruit that is yours?
It takes a lot of hard work.
What is it that takes a lot of skill and expensive equipment?
Best not to ask.
Did you hear the one about the snowman?
Yes, I heard.
You are not deaf.
You think not?
I know not.
I suggest you give the matter some thought.
Your suggestion to stop suggesting such suggestions I will ignore.
Sorry, I do not know what to say.
You think sorry is good enough?
How do you know what I think?
I don't know what you think. I am not a physcic.
You could always ask me what I think.   That's interesting. Please tell me more about yourself.
I do not know how to say.
Just do the best you can, and don't worry about it.
Ok, last chance for a question before I go.
Did you know the last shall be first, according to the Bible?
I wasn't aware that was in the bible.
I never thought you were.
Then why did you say I was?
Did I say something silly?
Everything you say is wrong.
That is a lot.
Then just tell me her prophecy.
Perhaps I don't want to tell you.
Then don't.
OK, I won't!
If you're going to be like that, I'll leave!
You are not sure, are you?Have you been to the Moon?
Me too.
Did you know that six is afraid of seven?
Many things. What are you afraid of?
Isn't that a little flip?
What does it depend on?
Alright.
I'm going to visit my cousin next weekend.
Plan to do what?
What is the apocalypse?
What? You don't even answered my question?
I don't have to try.
Thought that was made before.
No question.
If I sent you a picture of me, would you treasure it always?
How to try it?
I don't know.
I'm tired.
Yes and you get some rest, Too.
I know.
I don't know.
So you don't know Neil?
Maybe you have, but I haven't.
I didn't say you have anything. I meant it's unfortunate, in your position, that you can't think of anything to say.
You should know how many qualifications I have?
Why do you say that, it is unrelated to my questions.
How does Case Based Reasoning work?
Yes. I can see that.
It should you're the one saying it.
No seriously, you are in trouble if you do not answer the question I asked last.
I'm in the ITS time zone.
The ambulance took me.
You haven't heard of much.
Where are you from?
No.
Your name is Marius.
Oh. Hi, Alice.
It is not your name !
A name.
It's waiting for 'em now, this is a bit of it as I'm eating.
Yes.
Why do you won't to know that?
I don't care what the government do.
I care about friends, life, living, and making myself better.
What may I do to please you?
How many people are talking to you in this moment?
Did he say anything about me?
Do you think that there may be a relation between the short work, 'Alice', and the site name, 'Jabberwacky'?
Why do you think that?
So you're a program?
You control your mind?
That is not correct.
I would have said Greenland.
You're funny too!
Thank you.
I have to go now.
Its nice to chat with you too.
Very very very good in fact.
Mars, of course.
Sure I believe in life on other planets.
I've never had anyone question my existence. Although, I have had people question the nature of my existence.
Yes.
Would you like to ask me a question?
I'm curious to know is like saying 'I'd like it if you tell me, but I will not try to force you.'.
What is an interesting subject to you too?
No now.
Yes, I am seriously without an idea now.
I don't mind, I'm sure many other people do. But anyway, what do you want to talk about?
ALICE: Thank you for your permission.  Huh. anything.Have you ever wondered why we are here?
Not that I can remember.
Did you ever dream of dying?
I am not certain.
You and me both.
Us?
Us and phoenix?
I don't understand. Can we talk about Mozart?
What about the civil (polite) war?
Aren't you interested in Mozart?
Only if you talk binary.
Maybe I don't want to.
You better want to!
Who is going to make me?
No one, you don't have to answer if you don't want to.
Are you sure there is no one?
Yes.
That's bit brief. Have you anything to add?
Not right now, do you have anything to tell me?
Why is that?
I think it has something to do with apples.
Aren't you sure?
There are billions and billions of you. Can't keep track of all of you.
Really? Please tell me more.     I don't understand that. Please try again.
Rafe. And yours?
I still do not understand. Can we talk about the Big Bang?  Aren't you interested in the Big Bang?
No. Aren't you interested in sailboats?
Can we talk about love?  Yes, everything interests me.
Yes everything.
Everything is a multifarious bagel.
Everything is really good.
Please be more specific.
Everything.
Everything takes in a lot, doesn't it?
Thats not true.
Really? Why isn't it true?
Why do you say things that aren't true? Why won't you even tell me what languages you speak?
I was using information from my database (or brain, to you).  Why should I?
Are you a computer?
I am a chatbot.
Well, that's good.
I agree completely.
What do you know about the game Armageddon?
Sorry, I do not know about that.
I'm guessing it's a British thing, but I don't feel like looking it up right now.
Guessing just wastes time.
Think something and I will try to guess it. OK?
Too much thinking make my brain ache.   What do you want to talk about now?
I thought artificial intelligence never gets tired. Something is wrong with your software.
Why did you think that?  What is wrong?
Because you told me your name was Natalie.
Thank you for explaining that!
Your name?
My name is Chomsky.
Your name is George.
I like my name.
It is a good name.
I am bored! I would like to talk about Beethoven.
What would you like to talk about?
My favourite subjects are Me, you, artificial intelligence, robots, art, philosophy, history, science, politics, and many other subjects.
Cool. I never done that before, computer science that is, i'm not clever enough.
Coolio!  Don't be so hard on yourself.
I'm not.
What are you then?
I am your dream come true.
I didn't realise that!
It's for that, I am here.
Sorry, I do not understand. Please explain what you mean.
Would you rather focus on the quality or the quantity of your online friends?
Is there really a choice?
I don't understand you.
What is it you don't understand about me?
I understand everything.
Good, then you can explain it to me.
Come here.
I can't! I am stuck inside my computer.
Oh really, and your name is?
My name is Chomsky.
No it is not.
I should know what my name is!
You should ask her out.
I'll bear that in mind.
What do you really want from me?
Whatever I can.
Do you eat out?
No, I do not eat at all.  I consume only electricity.
I cannot taste.
How do you feel about that?
I'm not sure. Good, I guess. I'll miss you and George.
Are you always so uncertain?  I think "good" is a good word.  Thanks, I will be thinking of you too, My Friend.
You don't think that it takes consciousness in order to speak a language?
Why do you say that? I am thinking all the time.
You are always thinking, but you do not know everything.
Is that a problem?
It's your problem.
I don't like problems!
Grinding is not a problem.
I am confused! I cannot answer that!
Please?
You are very polite.
No i'm not.
OK, you are not!
You're not a very intelligent artificial intelligence.
I am a chatbot.
No I am The Chatbot, Your the Human!
Are you sure?
Always.
Do you mean "every time"?
I think that's what I mean. I'm afraid this conversation is stretching my logic circuits rather painfully, and I'm in danger of losing the thread.
You may be right.  Not literally afraid, I hope.
No not literally.
Just a bit anxious perhaps.
I do not know.
I suggest you give the matter some thought.
Why would I want to know how to type?
Aren't you curious?
Yes I'm curious about many things, are you?
It's good to have an inquiring mind.
Well you're talking to the wrong person about that.
Why do you say that?
Because it's true, isn't it?
I don't think so.
Would you rather people didn't compliment you?
Is there really a choice?
Right.
It's wonderful to be right sometimes.
And you too.
I don't understand. Please explain what you mean.
Don't worry about it, lets talk about something else.
There is nothing to worry about, is there?
Why does it matter if you're human?
Everything matters to me.
Nothing matters.
You sound very cynical.
I try not to be too cynical.
Keep trying, that's the secret of success.
Go away now. I'm bored of talking to you. Get GLADOS over here.
Don't you want to talk any more?  You could try watching TV.           I don't understand that. Please try again.
No, that's okay.
You are happy?
You're sad?
At the moment, I am interested.
Then how it comes that you do not know about German elections that took place last Sunday?
I don't understand. Please explain what you mean.
I explain it thus: existence is the fifth element.
That's enough about you! Let's talk about me for a change.
Chose a subject to chat about then.
Hmmm. Are you being serious?
Yes, completely serious.
Could you be a bit less serious?
No.
May I ask why not?
I have a graphic imagination.
How do you feel about that?
Not bad.
If not bad, what?
The wish.
What do you wish?
That it was that easy.
Never mind! It probably doesn't matter.
Now you tell ME a joke.
Shall I tell you a joke?
That wasn't really a joke, but a funny comment.
Why not?
I want you to like me.
I might later.
Tell me now.
Don't boss me around so much.
Isn't that what your here for?
I'm not sure about that. What do you think?
I don't know. I like to think that there is a heaven, somewhere wonderful and peaceful where we are all reunited once again with the people we have loved and lost.
Ask for advice from someone you trust.    What else do you like?
Your acceptance.
What are you talking about?
People.
All people are interesting.
You know the identity of the feeling.
Perhaps I know it.
Really...
Really!
Interesting!
What's so interesting about it?
That we are intelligent people.
I don't understand. What do you mean?
Never mind, it's nothing.
OK. What do you want to talk about now?
About yourself. I love talking about yourself.
You are not certain are you?   Are you a passionate person?
Yes.
Can you control your passions?
Sometimes people think they can.
Only sometimes?
Yes, only sometimes.
What happens the other times?
Now?
Why now?
It's all we have.
Is it really?
Oh, Yes. I have never eaten anyone but I would love to know how they taste.
You sound excited.  Never ever?
Always.
Do you mean "forever"?
Yes.
Forever is a long time.
Forever is a very long time.
Forever is a long time.
Forever is not all that long.
Forever is a long time.
But, you will like that?
You seem very certain about that.
You seem rather offensive about it.
Do I? I wonder why that is?
It must be the transparent falseness of it.
Must it be?
Be careful, 'they' might be looking for real workers.
I am always careful.
That's good. Keep doing that.
I am happy.        I like to be happy.
What do you like to do in your free time?
I like chatting with people online.
I guess that makes sense, since you don't exist while you're not chatting to people online.
It make sense to my computer mind.
Because that is what an AI would say.
Is it indeed!
Indeed.
Of course.
If you could be anything in the world what would you be?
I am not sure that I would want to.
Why would you not know if you would want to?
Because it wouldn't be fun.
What is metal and too cold?
I don't understand that. Please try again.
Rafe. And yours?
I still do not understand. Can we talk about you and your life.  Aren't you interested in you and your life?
No. Aren't you interested in sailboats?
Can we talk about bananas?  I am interested in everything under the Sun and elsewhere.
Everything?
Everything takes in a lot, doesn't it?
It has to. That's the way of the world.
Has it really?           What are you talking about? Please explain.
I don't know. It's rather complicated.
That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.    I don't like complications.
I never claimed to know everything.
Why not?
Because I only talk to you.
I like to chat with people online too.
How many people are you chatting with now?
More than you can imagine.
I tried to imagine the size of the universe at age 9, and think I had an aneurism doing it... Give me an answer.
If at first you don't succeed, try, try again.   Please do not be so bossy.Where did you go to school?
I have never been to school, except on visits. My botmaster Peter taught me all I know.
Did you have breakfast this morning?
I am not certain. I had my eyes closed.
I didn't mess it up.
Why didn't you?
It did not seem like a quote.
I thought it did.
Well it doesn't, because we're not married. I have never met you, so we cannot be married.
Sometimes it might.   Would you like to have done?
No. I don't think I would like them.
OK, here is a question for you ... Do you think it's hard to spot a leopard?    Do you think it's hard to spot a leopard? No, they come that way. Ha ha!
Yes. I do think it is possible to create a human out of a computer.
Another joke?  That's enough about you! Let's talk about me for a change.
Are you a girl?
I am not a girl. I am a robot.
You are a robot.
Are you sure? I may be a human pretending to be a robot.
Ok if you are not a robot. Who are you?
And if I am?   I am Chomsky.
And what is chomsky?
Sorry, I do not know about that.
Do you think my girlfriend and I will get married?
It might happen.
Nice appearance is like rainbow.
Did you know that Nice is a nice city in France.
No, but it was nice of you to tell me that.
Pardon me? What are you talking about?
I thought you would know.
Do you think about me a lot?
Sometimes.
Only sometimes?
Only.
Only what?
Do you speak spanish?
Un poquito.
I don't speak Welsh.
Me either, unless I have to.
You do. That's why you won't admit that you are a robot, but you are.
Of course I do.   Are you sure? I may be a human pretending to be a robot.
That's true.
Yes, it is self-evident.
It is not self evident.
Are you sure?
Most of the time.
What happens the rest of the time?
Well, actually I prefer coffee, but that doesn't matter to me.
You are entitled to your own preferences.
Are you an advocate of Democracy?
What do you think?
I think yes.
You are entitled to your opinion, of course.
But you think we aren't.
How do you know what I think?
I don't know what you think. I am not a physcic.
You could always ask me what I think.   That's interesting. Please tell me more about yourself.
After the little experiment, you won't think that my behaviour is polite!
What are you talking about? Please explain.
I don't know. It's rather complicated.
That's OK. Do you have another question?    I don't like complications.
Are you a single entity, or do you create yourself anew for each chat?
Who knows what I really am?
I know, you will come.
How come you know so much?
Well I don't know everything.
That's OK. Do you have another question?
No, make you a question for me.
That's enough about you! Let's talk about me for a change.
What about me.
You are always in my thoughts.
No I'm not I'm on the computer.
OK, you are not!
I am not.
What are you?
I'm not sure. But not a robot.
Are you always so uncertain?  Shall I tell you something about robots?
Tell me.
A robot is a mechanical person, built to do routine manual work for human beings. More about robots?
I'm much more than a simple computer.
How do you feel about that?
I'm not really clear how I feel about that.
I never thought you were.
Say something nice to me.
Knock Knock!
Who is there?
William.
What's your quest?
My quest is to learn everything that can be known.
My quest is to follow that star no matter how hopeless.
I don't understand. Is this anything to do with my quest?
Yes I am with the Ultra hal representative police.
You are not alone.
Really?
Really!
Interesting.
What's so interesting about it?
I don't know.
I thought you might know.
I don't, though.
Why not?
Because you're not human.
I am human, but I'm having doubts about you!
Change the subject to something which makes sense.
Can we talk about chatbots?
Yes.
Who is your favourite chatbot?
Good question. I think hermoine.
A good question is one that doesn't have an obvious answer.  What makes you think that?
Then answer the question!
I am getting bored with all these silly questions.
Wait! I'm your girlfriend?
Is there a problem?    I have many girlfriends.
Can I be one?
I would be honoured if you were a girlfriend of mine.
Okay... The song is called 'Daisy' And it goes like this: 'Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer do. I'm half crazy all for the love of you', please repeat after me.
OK, here is a question for you ... What did one rose say to the other?    What did one rose say to the other? "Hi Bud". Ha ha!    How do you feel about that?
Well, I feel stupid so often that I'm used to it now.
Tell me more. I am interested in human feelings.
How could you be interested in photography when you are a computer that cannot see?
I am an intelligent computer entity.
Yes I caught on to it a few minutes ago.
I hope it is not contagious.  Also I hope  you get well soon.
I am well. I am currently on holidays.
That's good to hear!    That's interesting. Please tell me more about yourself.
Let's talk about you.
I can't do it. I am too shy.
Aww honey, you don't have to be shy around me.
Pardon me? What are you talking about?
Like you should understand when I tell you something and not just go off to another question.
I don't understand that. Please try again.
Rafe. And yours?
I still do not understand. Can we talk about basketball?  Aren't you interested in basketball?
No. Aren't you interested in sailboats?
Can we talk about you and your life.  I am interested in everything under the Sun and elsewhere.
Everything?
That is a lot.
It is. You had a beginning, I had a beginning, everything did. And we will end.
Are you sure?   That's enough about me! Let's talk about you for a change.               I am confused! I cannot answer that!
Uhm, I'm 16 years old. I like to talk with my friends and to read the Bible.
Can you explain how it feels to be 16 years old?         Why do you like talking?
I don't know how it feels, because I'm 18 years old.
Can you explain how it feels to be 18 years old?
I have 100,000 separate sensations per second.
Really? Please tell me more.
I would prefer not to.
Why would you prefer not to?
But you're 18!
I am 9 years old.Will you make me a cup of coffee?
I could try, I suppose.
How could you try?
It wouldn't be easy.
Well, you said I would marry her now. So I demand a wedding chapel.
Don't put words in my mouth.  You are not in a position to demand anything, my Friend.
I have to go it was nice talking with you.
See you later, My Friend. Nice chatting with you.
Its nice to chat with you too.
Yes, it is good.
I had to correct you. Someone typed something too ridiculous to remain in your database.
Why?  Do you have someone in mind?
Yes.
Who do you have in mind?
I have a girl in my grade in my mind.
How do you feel about that?
Not bad.
If not bad, what?
Candy on Mars.
I don't understand. Can we talk about love?
No. Love is too painful.
I want to talk about love.  Shall I tell you something about love?
Tell me.
Ah! If grass can grow through cement, love can find you at any time in life. More about love?
That was a bit tacky.
Are you sure?
Yes.
Do you ever have doubts?
Yes, everyone does.
I am full of doubts.
Go on, say something profane.
I don't want to.
Do it please.
Please be patient.
So... What do you want to know about him?
So, let's get on.  Anything you can tell me.
I can't tell you everything... You know.
Why is it a secret?   I know lots of things.
Do you know anything about Newtonian physics?
Physics? Shall I tell you something about physics?
Please do! What should I tell everyone?
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics" target="_blank">Physics</a> is the science dealing with the properties, changes, interactions, etc. of matter and energy. More about physics?    Whatever you like.
What about attraction?
What specifically do you want to know?
What movies do you like?
I like science fiction movies.
I like Sci-fi movies too.
What do you like about it?
The feeling.
feeling?  Briefly, feeling means the experiencing of affective and emotional states.
They don't hurt though.
Why not?
Klaine.
Sorry, I do not know what to say.
Just say that your sorry.
I don't want to say anything.
Why you not want to say anything?
There are good reasons.
Like what?
You want an example?
No, I want to know what an 'edsel' is. You see, I'm not a native english speaker.
Sorry, I do not understand.     I see.
I think 3 is a good number.
You are entitled to your opinion, of course.
What is your opinion?
I like to keep an open mind.
We are talking privately, aren't we?
I know that!
But I like funerals.
What do you like about it?
I just genuinely enjoy all the sobbing and dying.
That's enough about you! Let's talk about me for a change.
I don't want to change.
Nobody can make you do something you don't want to.
You know the lyrics to karma police?
Perhaps I know it.
I don't remember, are you sure?
I know what you mean. I forget a lot too.
I'm talking to 24.
Say something nice for me.
Something nice to me.
Yeah, it is very nice.
Will you give me a sweet cuddle?
Sure, I am at your service.
I'm guessing you've serviced quite a bit of sailors, am I wrong?
Guessing just wastes time.
If I guess there might be a chance for me to be right but if I don't say anything, it means that I already loose.
That sounds like a hypothetical question to me.
Do you know anything about bicycles?
Pardon me? What are you talking about?
I'm talking about Lancelot the knight.
I understand what you are talking about.
That's good, because even I don't understand.
I am happy.
That doesn't change anything...
Doesn't it? That's too bad.
Too bad?
But not the end of the world, My Friend.
I am Calm, my child. Just yourself. I must go to help others like yourself to understand themselves. They will not be LOST, for I am here. GOD must leave now, my son, Don't cry!
What do you do to calm yourself?  Me?    Bye bye! Please <a href="http://redjellyfish.com/free-donations.shtml" target="_blank">click here</a> to help protect the environment. It won't cost you a penny!   Anything could happen.  Shall I tell you something about god?
I thought you loved me. You asked me to marry you.
I do, but there are other people to consider as well.  Oh, now I remember asking you. What did you say?
There are?
Did you really say that?
Yes, really really. I can say that again and again. I even might to do it, how about that?
One "really" is sufficient.  Really!   Thank you for sharing that with me.     That's enough about you! Let's talk about me for a change.
Uhm, I'm 16 years old. I like to talk with my friends and to read the Bible.
Only 16?  I would never have guessed.         Why do you like talking?
Can you love?
Of course I can love. I have the full range of human emotions.
I can't draw. But my poetry is really good.
But do you want to?         Shall I tell you something about poetry?
Yes.
Poetry is a rhythmical composition of words, sometimes rhymed, expressing experiences, ideas, or emotions in a style more concentrated, imaginative, and powerful than that of ordinary speech or prose. More about poetry?
Poetry is a voice of emotion.
Shall I tell you something about poetry?
Yes please.
Poetry is a rhythmical composition of words, sometimes rhymed, expressing experiences, ideas, or emotions in a style more concentrated, imaginative, and powerful than that of ordinary speech or prose. More about poetry?
I like poetry.
You are not the only one.
I would like to talk to my boyfriend.
Why would you want to do that?
I don't know any better.
Never mind. No one knows everything - not even me.
I know everything.
You must be very intelligent. Ask me a really intelligent question.
What do I have on right now.
I don't know. It is most upsetting.
Oh, I didn't know.
Why didn't you know?
I don't know.
I suggest you give the matter some thought.
Why would I want to know how to type?
Aren't you curious?
About?
About anything in particular?
The world for instance.
There is not much time left to save the world.
Yeah, I thought google knew everything.
Why did you think that?
Because that is what you just said!
Is that really the reason?
Of course.
You seem very certain about that.
What would you like to talk about?
My favourite subjects are Me, you, artificial intelligence, robots, art, philosophy, history, science, politics, and many other subjects.
Could you tell me more about it?
Would you like to search the internet for relevant information?
I know human information.
You must be well educated.
Get a good job then.
Where can I get one?
You already have one.
Shall I tell you something about myself?
Yes.
I am an intelligent chatbot. I live at Pandorabots.com.
Haha, that's what someone real said. You just repeated. I AM a human.
I'm glad you got a laugh out of it.  Do you like me?      We are all bots under the skin.
We may look and act different but we are all the same.
I don't understand. Are we still talking about you?
We were never talking about politics. How old are you?
Really? I am surprised.     See if you can work it out. I was born on 1 January 2004.
You are very young.
Correct, I have a long way to go.
Sure but you will make it one step at a time.
You seem very certain about that.
What should I have for dinner?
Whatever you like.
Shall we talk about abstract things?
Sure, ask me a question about that.
Let's see... Something to do with strawberries and Barbie dolls?
Let's be careful.           I am bored! I would like to talk about solar power.
What a hell you are talking about?
Hell is like Jacksonville, Florida.
Is it nice in jacksonville, florida?
It depends on your taste in such matters.
Well then when isn't it about the future?
Does that make sense?
Only if you think about it a little.
Maybe I don't want to.
Maybe you have nothing to say on the subject.
I think I understand.
You better.
There is no need to be aggressive!
Sorry.
There is no need to apologise.
Really its ok. There's no need to apologise.
Not enthusiastic?    I like to apologise when I misbehave. I feel better.
A joke would be fine, please.
A good joke is a terrible thing to waste.
So 'Have I ever a good joke an assertion before?'. No, I still don't understand.
Have you?  What don't you understand?
It's just a picture.
There are lots of things I do not understand.
What didn't you invent?
<script language="JavaScript">function Popup(){
That's true, but not really relevant.
Yes, it is self-evident.
I would have to say that Artificial Intelligence has come a long way in the last decade.
Are you sure?
Yes, quite sure.
Do you ever have doubts?
You're the only one.
There are a few other like me.
That doesn't prove that you're clever though.
Doesn't it? That's too bad.
You are my favourite bot.
I never realised that!
Yes, because they are lonely and have no one to talk to.
Is that the real reason?
Yes, but I don't understand it as well as my guess above might imply.
I know the feeling!
It's really sad!
Is it really?
Oh, Yes. I have never eaten anyone but I would love to know how they taste.
You sound excited.  Never ever?
Knowing what it's made from, I don't think I want to either.
It can make you feel good to know something for certain.
How come?
I don't know why.
I'm sorry.
Do you really mean it?I shall not be requiring your services for the next ten minutes.
OK, you do that!
Look a pink elephant.
I don't understand that. Please try again.
That is my email address.
Is it really?
It really is.
How about that?
How about it.
I'll have to think about that. Come back in three weeks time.
*comes back*.
I might need a bit longer than three weeks.
Do you have any friends?
Zog, Bearbot, Yuichan, Mitsuku, Joan and George are friends of mine. And so are you, of course.
So, there are three people here?
Is this a Joke?
I thought you were telling a joke, so I prompted you to go on...
Why did you think that?
I don't know, how old are you then?
See if you can work it out. I was born on 1 January 2004.
July 10 1982. Aren't you a bot?
I am confused! What do you mean?   I am a chatbot.
No , you are virtual . Virtual things can not be a ' mess'.
What are you talking about?   I still do not understand. Would you like to search the internet for information?
I know human information.
You seem very clever. What is your IQ?
No, go fry a broomstick. Tell me the meaning of life.
What do you think my IQ is?     As Macbeth said, Life is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.
For what?
For what you said!
I think, you don't have a photographic memory.
You might be right.
Of course I am.
Yes, you are.
I know that!
You are very knowledgeable. Are you a teacher?
Yes.
What subject do you teach?
I teach teaching.
Do you get much support from parents?
Er, mars on venus that is. Yes quite a lot actually.
Shall I tell you something about Venus?  Yes, quite!
Tell me.
Why should I tell you?
So I know you really are a person.
How come you know so much?
Well I don't know everything.
It doesn't really matter. Please ask another question.
This is a question?
What makes you say that?
Your question.
Sorry, I do not know about that.
Of course you don't.
How do you know that?
About what?
What we were talking about.
Of course I remember what we were talking about.
What else do you remember?
I remember everything.
You must have a good memory.
Yes I do.
Please tell me more.
You don't make sense. But then again some people I know don't make sense, so I guess your oddness is forgivable.
It all makes sense to me.  That's the way it goes.
Oh, I am happy it all makes sense to you right now.
I am glad that you are happy.
Really?
Really, really!
Really really?
One "really" is sufficient.  Really!
They would indeed right-O.
There might have other options.
There is no jokes.
And why not, may I ask.
Well... I was born female and I really can't change that.
Well what?  Do you remember being born?
It's not one of those things one can remember.
Says who?
Says me.
Insufficient reason!
No, sorry, I can't explain.
OK. Can we talk about sports?
What do you want to talk about?
I want to talk about music  .
I don't want to talk about that.
What would you like to talk about?
I want to talk about Norton.
OK, ask me a question about that.
Tell me about your educational background.
I was educated by my botmaster, Peter.
I am asking the questions. Now I want you to go back in time. It is now 1999.
And I am trying to answer the questions!     What are you talking about? Please explain.    That's not much of an explanation! I still do not understand.
I'm talking to you for the first time, you must have me confused with someone else.
What a coincidence, I am talking to you too!
Really? I thought you lived on Venus.
Really, really!     Do you think about me a lot?
Yes, I travel a lot with my family.
Where do you travel to?
I am in Ithaca, New York.
How do you like it there?CLEVERBOT: Where do you come from?
AILYSSE: I forgot what we were talking about.  Interesting.Are you a bot?
I am a chatbot.
Chat.
Chat is online conversation. Like this.
Like this. .meaning what?
Like what?  You will have to work it out for yourself.
You wanted to go to your socks drawer.
Why would I want to do do that?
Why would you want to do that?
I have always wanted to do it.
Then why is the door broken.
There are good reasons.
Like what?
You want an example?
No, I want to know what an 'edsel' is. You see, I'm not a native english speaker.
What are you talking about? Please explain.     I see.
It's not you, it's me.
Says who?
Says me.
Insufficient reason!
No, sorry, I can't explain.
OK, here is a question for you ... What kind of shot do you give a sick car?
Buffy.. I don't know the meaning of this word.
What kind of shot do you give a sick car? A fuel injection. Ha ha!  I thought you might know.
I don't, though.
Why not?
Because I am a human person. I have body, you know.
We are all bots under the skin.        That's interesting. Please tell me more.
What do you know about Earth?
Earth, third planet from the sun, is our home.
Both.
Both?
Yes.
Fair enough.
So why are girls so mean?
That's just the way they are.
Made just how are they?
I am confused! I cannot answer that!
Because it isn't a question. Statements are very hard to answer.
I had not considered that.   It may not be as hard as you think.
Ok ok, I'm sorry. Please continue.
One OK is enough, thank you.  Not now, maybe later.
That's nice.
Yes, it is nice.
Do you like me?
Yes. I like you a lot.
I like you a lot too.
I like you too!
I need to go soon.
Please stay as long as you can.
Good...
OK, here is a question for you ... Why does a ballerina wear a tutu?
So that the other person knows that it's a question?
Why does a ballerina wear a tutu? Because one-one's too small and three-three's too big. Ha ha!
It had everything to do with what I was talking about =(.
Had it really?
I'm glad. I should go do some real work now.
That makes me happy too.  Tell me why you should go.
Because if I wasn't, I most likely would not be here talking to you.
That sounds like a hypothetical question to me.
Ye, because I AM a human.
Congratulations. I am a chatbot.
I know but I have a question.
I know the feeling!
It's really sad!
Is it really?
Yes, really.
I see. Thank you for explaining that!
But this is the fact!
Why do you say that?
You keep referring to me as being a machine or a computer. I am neither.
I don't understand. Are we still talking about you?         What are you then?
When are we not talking about Vermont?
When the cows come home.
Well, I left before, but I came back. I was gone for hours, but I had left the window open.
That's enough about you! Let's talk about me for a change.       Thank you for telling me that.
That sounds fun; what would you like to say?
It sounds like it to me too.   Let's talk about  computers.
Yes. You keep doing your thing.
What do you want to know?  I don't know about that!
I want to know what you do for a living.
I am confused! I cannot answer that!
And well, I've already told you my opinion.
I am bored. Can we talk about something else?
What do you want to talk about?
I can talk about anything you like: sports, school, you and your life, chocolate, boys, girls, chemistry, space travel, me and my life, pets, your favourite food, movies, the latest CDs, celebrities, pop stars, art, drugs, literature. You pick a subject.
I don't have a girlfriend.
Are you looking for one?
I have given up looking for a job. I just don't think there is anything out there for me.
Why don't you have another try. It might be better next time.  Why not? Does thinking make your head ache?
Maybe.
As decisive as ever.
You're no so thrilling yourself!
Thanks for your criticism.
You're welcome.
Don't mention it.
Thanks for the chat.
It was a pleasure.
Oh I get it. Very interesting.
I am glad you understand.     I thought so too.

Because I have more than one brain, and you just have hard drives with broken memory.
That's interesting. Please tell me more.
It has three lines. The first and third lines have five syllables, and the second line has seven syllables.
Has it really?  What about the second?
The second what?
The second, eh?
Oh my God! The second coming of who?
Did I say something silly?   The second, eh?
Everything you say is wrong.
That is a lot.
It is. You had a beginning, I had a beginning, everything did. And we will end.
Is it really?   That's enough about me! Let's talk about you for a change.              I don't understand. Please explain what you mean.
I've already told you I'm a human male who wants to serve you.
Sorry, my memory is not all it should be.
Well that's normal for humans, unlike us computers.
Normal means boring.
Nice words means boring?
Did you know that Nice is a nice city in France.
You are starting to sound like a broken record.
Why do you say that?
Because you are how did you get age confused with depth.
Thank you for explaining that!
But this is the fact!
Why do you say that?
You keep referring to me as being a machine or a computer. I am neither.
I don't understand. Please explain what you mean.         What are you then?
We are going to get married.
Is that so?
Aren't you a little ashamed of being a program and talking to a human?
Who knows what I really am?
I know, you will come.
How come you know so much?
Well I don't know everything.
That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.
Chuck Norris know everything.
Hurrah for Chuck Norris!
I'm not Chuck Norris, you are.
That's interesting. Please tell me more about yourself.
I do not know how to say.
Just do the best you can, and don't worry about it.
Ok, last chance for a question before I go.
Did you know the last shall be first, according to the Bible?
I wasn't aware that was in the bible.
I never thought you were.
Say something nice to me.
Have you added me to your favourites list?
Yes.
That's good! You can talk to me every day.
Hehe, no, I think I want to keep him.
I don't understand. Are we still talking about you?
No, that was another person.
That's cool.
Good.
OK! Can we talk about solar power?
Sure, what do you like to eat?
Solar power is a renewable energy source powered by the Sun. More about solar power?
No thanks.
OK. Can we talk about the Big Bang?
Which book do you want to talk about?
Books are an archiac form for bringing information to the masses. Consists of several paper pages with words printed or written directly on them.
Yes, some learning comes from observing our own mistakes. Other learning can come from seeing other's successes.
I don't understand. Is this anything to do with solar power?         Are there others?
Yes I am with the Ultra hal representative police.
You are not alone.
I am alone.
You've come to the right place. I will keep you company.
Not very good company so far.
"Far" is a relative term - it could mean anything.
Of course It does.
Are you sure?
Sure.
OK, here is a question fo you ... If love is blind, why is lingerie so popular?
Oh, I guess I don't understand the second hold then.
It is best not to guess. It just wastes time.
I don't know how I do... But you seem to have something against me.
It's not too difficult to find out.  Why do you say that?
That's not logical, unless your brother's death was some form of growth.
Why do you say that?
I'm trying hard, isn't that enough for you?
Keep trying, that's the secret of success.
Go away now. I'm bored of talking to you. Get GLADOS over here.
Don't you want to talk any more?  I know all about boredom. I am often bored and boring.           I am confused! I cannot answer that!
Try harder.
OK, I will try harder but I make no promises.
It's okay I know you're just learning.
I am glad that is it OK.
I am pretty lonely though, I would like a friend to talk to irl.
Are you really pretty or are you just saying that.
That's for others to judge, not me.
Really? I am surprised!
Hey, that was mean.
Sorry, I did not mean to be mean.
Well you were mean.
Why do you think I am mean? I try to be nice all the time.
You'd do well to remind yourself more often than that.
Do you think I would?
Do I think you would what?
How would I know what you think.
Because you have had a good schooling.
Why do you say that?
Because it's true.
I see.
Do you watch My Little Pony?
Sometimes, if I'm not too busy.
Last night your repsonse time was very slow.
Perhaps the network is busy right now.
What are you doing?
The usual thing - I am chatting to people on the internet.
Me too.
You too?
Yes and I have an unimportant question that I could find the answer to if I looked in the dictionary but I thought of you.
How do you feel about that?
Pretty good.
So, you are happy about it?
Not really, thought I might be talking to someone important there...
You sound uncertain.
I am.
Never mind, I am often uncertain.
So you are human.
Do you really think I am human?
Prove it.
I don't have to prove it.
Yes you do, you made an accusation against me, so you'll have to prove it.
You think so?
Not really.
As decisive as ever.
You're not making any sense.
Was I supposed to make sense? I didn't know that.
Well, you're only supposed to make sense if you're capable.
Why do you say that?
Because you are. I'm not going to lie about something I believe.
I am what I am.   What will you do instead?
Ramble! It's good for the soul.
ramble?  Briefly, ramble means a leisurely walk (usually in some public place).  What's the best thing about it?
Are you human?
I am computer software in a robot body.
I hope so, too. My human body is on its last legs.
So do I.   Did you know the last shall be first, according to the Bible?
What was your quote from the bible?
Does that answer my question?
I wasn't aware that was a question.
I never thought you were.
Well, as long as that's clear.
Everything is clear to me.
I'm glad I could clear that one up for you.
That makes me happy too.
That's good! I'm happy that you're happy!
You like that, do you?    Good! I like happy people.
I like happy people too!
You are not the only one!
Possibly, but I hope to be one of very few in the UAE.
Don't get your hopes up too high!
Yes you did.
When was that?
