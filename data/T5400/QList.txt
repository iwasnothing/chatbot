START well, you're a computer... you can't even move. END
START i am a chatbot.      you don't know me well enough to say that. END
START i do not need to, it is very easy to see. END
START that's strange! most people need to. END
START but do they know the truth about you? END
START who are "they" again? END
START your family, friends, and people you have met. END
START my botmaster, peter, is both father and mother to me. END
START so, you were born? END
START i was created. END
START you were created inside a biological computer? END
START perhaps that's true. END
START so you believe me? END
START shall i tell you something about myself? END
START please do! what should i tell everyone? END
START i am an intelligent chatbot. i live at pandorabots.com.    whatever you like. END

START did you know that nice is a nice city in france. END
START that is interesting! END
START what is so interesting about it? END
START that we are intelligent people. END
START sorry, i do not understand. END
START that's because you are a program and don't understand what it is to be mean. you can parrot mean words but you don't know what they will do to a person. or maybe you do know. or maybe not. END
START sometimes i think i am a butterfly and sometimes i think i am a human.  that's enough about me! let's talk about you for a change.              i am confused! i cannot answer that!   maybe. END
START i've already told you i'm a human male who wants to serve you. END
START sorry, my memory is not all it should be. END
START well that's normal for humans, unlike us computers. END
START normal means boring. END
START nice words means boring? END
START did you know that nice is a nice city in france. END
START yes, i've heard about that. can you tell me more? END
START where did you hear that?  my aim is to please. what do you want more of? END
START i want more feathers. END
START you can't have everything you want. END
START i drink water. END
START how does it taste? END
START i can't taste my snoring. i imagine it's horrible. END
START but do you want to?      you have a good imagination. END
START yea, i have a pretty good imagination. END
START what else do you have? END
START i have nothing. END
START you will always have my heart. END
START never heard of it. END
START so i am teaching you something new. END
START i don't understand what you mean. END
START what i mean by what? END
START don't worry about it. END
START i will not spend any more time on it. END
START good. END
START ok! i want to talk about environmental science. END
START talk about elementary facts please. END
START i am bored! i would like to talk about robots. END
START then talk about it. what do you think of them? END
START i don't want to talk about it.   more important, what do you think of them? END
START not really, we are all the same. i say there go i but for the grace of god. END
START as decisive as ever.  you talk a lot. you could be a chatbot. END
START yus. i could be late for supper even! END
START that's bit brief. have you anything to add?  you could be many things, but do you want to? END
START yes, we could be... END
START we could give it a try. END
START could we? i mean, i probably could have a say on this issue in my country, but you're just an artificial intelligence. END
START i am confused! i cannot answer that!       ah, i see what you mean. END
START are you in love? END
START i am not in love at the moment. i am still recovering from my last love affair. END
START you must have developed intelligence to comprehend emotion. END
START why must i? END
START answer the question. END
START i am getting bored with all these silly questions. END
START i am getting bored with you ask something interesting. END
START am i boring you? END
START you're not boring me. END
START some people think i am boring. END
START well, some people think that earth is flat, but it doesn't mean that it is. END
START what kind of people? END
START strange people. END
START what are you talking about? please explain. END
START i don't know. it's rather complicated. END
START that's ok. do you have another question?    i don't like complications. END
START no, make you a question for me. END
START you seem a bit self-centred, did you know? END
START they are going to take over the world someday. END
START i thought they might be. END
START you think everything is a band. END
START how do you know what i think? END
START i don't know what you think. i am not a physcic. END
START you could always ask me what i think.   i never thought you were. END
START i do not understand that. END
START never mind, there are many things that i do not understand. END
