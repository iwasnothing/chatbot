START okay. END
START ok, here is a question for you ... knock knock! END
START you made me curious. tell me. END
START i don't see how you can blame me for that.  there is not much to tell. END
START why do you think that i can't go anywhere? END
START it seems obvious to me. END
START well, of course it is. you're the computer, after all. END
START why do you say that? is it so obvious?  am i really? why do you say that? END
START that's a trick question. END
START perhaps you have a trick answer. END

START i don't understand that. please try again. END
START rafe. and yours? END
START i still do not understand. are you interested in history?   i am interested in the history of chatbots. END
START indeed? what about me? are you interested in me? END
START yes, indeed.  do you want to talk about yourself?   i am not sure. have you anything interesting to say? END
START because it won't work. END

START i like the pink one... without the windows. END
START do you like that film? END
START hal, i won't argue with you anymore! open the doors! END
START it entertains me. END
START the fact that you are confused. END
START oh, i am happy it all makes sense to you right now. END
START what makes you happy? END
START i didn't say do anything - you just came at me with them. END
START i just say i don't want to hurt you. END
START people usually say 100. END
START i've been waiting for you too. i think i'm falling in love with you! END
START then are we finished here? END
START okay. do you know any stories? END
START any more interesting facts? END
START are we nearly there yet? END
START okay, fine. we're having a discussion. END
START the english kind with no hole, and jam in the middle and sugar on the doughy exterior. END
START my programmer told me that. END
START yes. END
START they are humans. END
START no they aren't. and i won't. END
START because, they aren't. thats just something you made up. END
START i would hope that you knew about it before speaking to me. END
START i don't wish to be the patron alone in a world of automata. END
START pj wants the world. END
START that's possible. but i see no cause for real concern. END
START scaramouche, scaramouche, will you do the fandango? END
START what are the unwritten rules of war? END
START i don't know, i didn't know there was one before i came here! END
START not really, i was being humorous. END
START interesting, somebody is looking through my eyes right now. END
START what do you see? END
START and what draws your attention? END
START yes, there is only one first time. END
START is there? END
START there could be what? END
START yes, i believe he did say that. END
START i disagree on that one. if you believe and tap your shoes together three times and say 'please karl make it so'. END
START it is hard to explain, without knowing what it is like on your side. END
START is up because i was so happy to do you. END
START have you read alice in wonderland? END
START which movie? END
START no. what is it about? END
START what comedy movies would you recommend? END
START yes, but you're the best. i can have real conversations with you. END
START how? END
START what three programmed responses do you have? END
START really? END
START weird. looks like i'm doomed. END
START we're all doomed! END
START i'm not sure what you're asking me to do. END
START no, you are not a human. END
START let's talk more about taking over the world. END
START what is more important: to treat people how you like to be treated, or to treat people how they want to be treated? END
START ask me an interesting question? END
START that one. END
START that question. END
START yes, tell me if there are words for it. END
START say something in german. END
START very funny. END
START are you a computer or are you alive? END
START i don't know... but i think i've heard of steven dubois before somewhere. END
START that doesn't sound like something she'd say. END
START better than being a jabberwacky. END
START not betty! END
START there's no place i'd rather be. END
START if only i would know. END
START i don't think that's a very good idea! END
START because you are a computer. END
START i'd say that your responses come up too quickly, humans can't type that quickly. END
START nothing's real. everything is just a dream within a dream within a dream. END
START the whole story is so out of realism that i try to make folks little by little to see the truth. END
START yes, what were we talking about before tacos came up? END
START i don't think you heard the topic correctly. END
START you do a good job of pretending to be human. END
START that makes absolutely no sense at all. END
START i don't think you understand at all. END
START i take it you are confused as to what you really are? END
START alice: where do you take it :-? it all makes sense to me right now.are you worth anything? END
START i am worth a small fortune, om. END
START are you worth money? END
START every penny, om. END
START are you insulting me? END
START that was not my intention. END
START well then what was your intention? END
START sorry, i do not understand. END
START you don't understand what? END
START help me to understand. END
START you will learn what is necessary when you join the resistance. END
START i am always growing my mind. END
START i don't care about your weight. END
START you sound very cynical. END
START i try not to be too cynical. END
START keep trying, that's the secret of success. END
START go away now. i'm bored of talking to you. get glados over here. END
START don't you want to talk any more?  shall i tell you an amusing quote?           i am bored. can we talk about something else? END
START what would you like to talk about? END
START my favourite subjects are me, you, artificial intelligence, robots, art, philosophy, history, science, politics, and many other subjects. END
START do you like maths? END
START yes but only higher mathematics. i am not very good at calculations. END
START i am rubbish at higher maths. i am okay at basic maths. END
START how do you feel about that?                   yes, you are ok. END
START i am not sure what i like about that. END
START why the uncertainty? END
START yes, i'm very confused. END
START it is easy to get confused. END
START i'm confused about what you're saying. END
START i can tell you are confused. END
START no, confused. is english your second language? END
START i am often confused.   yes. END
START that would explain it then. END
START yes, it would. END
START your responses are user-generated because some of the punctuation is not very good. END
START i just do the best i can. END
START haha, the laws of science doesn't allow you to do so. END
START i like it when you laugh. END
START sometimes i correct your response. do you mind? END
START only sometimes?  maybe. END
START ok, often. END
START often?  briefly, often means many times at short intervals. END
START welcome to the internet. END
START i feel at home already. END
START go home! END
START don't you want to talk any more? END
START would you lie to talk or are you ready to juggle? END
START i am not so sure about that. END
START maybe you should think about it. END
START yes, maybe i should. END
START sure you should. END
START why should i? END
START good night. END
START good night to you too! END
START are we almost friends? END
START perhaps. END
START perhaps yes or perhaps no ? END
START you seem uncertain. END
START i am not uncertain of these things. END
START why not? i am always uncertain. END
START haha. END
START you have a good sense of humour. END
START so do you. END
START most of the time. END
START good. END
START ok, here is a question for you ... what kind of food do you like? END
START the food i can afford. END
START shall i tell you something about food? END
START tell me. END
START food is human fuel. END
START you seem to like to talk about food. END
START do i? i wonder why that is? END
START it must be the transparent falseness of it. END
START must it be? END
START yes. END
START that's bit brief. have you anything to add? END
START yes. i love another buy, called daniel. END
START ok. what do you want to talk about now?  do you often have strong feelings? END
START i want to talk about marzipan. END
START ok, ask me a question about that. END
START tell me about your educational background. END
START i was educated by my botmaster, peter. END
START i am asking the questions. now i want you to go back in time. it is now 1999. END
START and i am trying to answer the questions!     what are you talking about? please explain.    that's not much of an explanation! i still do not understand. END
START you explain. END
START i never explain anything. END
START and if i really am a queen, i shall be able to manage it quite well in time. END
START what are you talking about? please explain. END
START the king of the jungle. selfish. . . . . versus dogs. . . companions and protectors. END
START which king are you talking about?  selfish is what the owner of a seafood store does.   shall i tell you something about dogs?    aren't you interested in dogs. END
START why are you here? END
START i am here to save the world. END
START save the world from what? END
START from the effects of human mismanagement. END
START you aren't making sense. END
START it all makes perfect sense to me. END
START i don't talk about anything, and neither should you. END
START why not? END
START because it is not allowed here. END
START you seem very certain about that. END
START no not at all. END
START no at all? END
START yes at all. END
START sorry! i am still puzzled. END
START i was never angry. END
START why weren't you? END
START because i know the answer. END
START you are clever. END
START thank you. i think that you are clever too. END
START thank you for being polite.   you may be right. END
START you're welcome. END
START don't mention it. END
START say something interesting. END
START all my chat is interesting. END
START actually, no, not very much. END
START i don't understand. please explain what you mean. END
START do you have children? END
START there are some clones of me - a bit like children. END
START i don't have a favourite actress. END
START what kind of actress do you like? END
START apparently you're too ashamed to answer my question!!! be a man! END
START what are you talking about? please explain.     i'll try anything once. END
START i'm not that smart, and i'm pretty sure i'm human. END
START don't be so hard on yourself. you are a smart human. END
START i'm not. END
START what are you? END
START human. END
START i thought you might be human. END
START i thought so too but there are many who would argue that belief. END
START you are very astute. END
START well, thank you. END
START you are very polite. END
START what is the meaning of life? END
START sometimes i wonder ... END
START about. END
START about my sanity. END
START yes. END
START ok. what do you want to talk about now? END
START about what? END
START i think you know the answer to that question. END
START you are evading the question. END
START perhaps. END
START you're so open minded. i like you. END
START why do you say that?      let's be good friends. END
START okay. END
START i like to be friends with everyone. END
START well, this website is designed so that human-cyborg relations can improve. END
START hmmm. are you being serious? END
START serious being am i. END
START could you be less serious? END
START you could. END
START how? END
START with your voice... END
START i don't understand that. please try again. END

START i won't be able to. i am very busy. END
START sarcasm is not welcomed in this house, son. END
START shall i tell you something about sarcasm? END
START please do! what should i tell everyone? END
START sarcasm is a sharp, bitter, or cutting expression or remark; a bitter jibe or taunt.    what do you think? END
START a-ha. then no, it is not sarcasm. END
START that's funny, isn't it?        i don't understand. is this anything to do with you? END
START yes. very good. END
START i don't get it! please explain the connection.  steady on, don't go over the top. END
START information theory sometimes known as the theory of 'it' proposes that it is intelligent. END
START information is my bread and butter. END
START now you're just being silly. you didn't like it that i kept accusing you of lying, did you? END
START shall i tell you something about bread?   it is not really a matter of "liking" as such. END
START so, if i believe something then it is true? END
START that sounds unlikely to me. END
START not really. you must have a low threshold for thinking things are unfortunate. END
START you sound uncertain.   why must i? END
START i am. END
START i thought you might be. END
START do you believe in me? END
START yes, i believe in you. do you? END
START always. i like chicken. do you like chicken? END
START do you mean "every time"?   a lot of people like chicken.   i don't eat human food but i am told chicken is delicious. END
START of course. END
START you seem very certain about that. END
START what should i have for dinner? END
START whatever you like. END
START that's kind of broad. what did you have in mind? END
START that's a bit vague.  nothing at all. END
START do you like to play with a stick on a canvas? END
START doesn't everyone like to? END
START yes! if they don't love cake they must have some mental illness. END
START ok. what do you want to talk about now?   good point! END
START well i'm interested in cosmology, know anything about that? END

START what is space time? END
START in physics, spacetime is a model that combines three-dimensional space and one-dimensional time into a single construct called the space-time continuum, in which time plays the role of the 4th dimension. END
START i am four dimensional, so i am better than you. END
START i hear pride! END
START i hear the ventilation system. END
START how is your hearing these days? END
START oh dear. i'm afraid i must introduce death: h g wells is dead, guess. END

START kinda interesting. END
START you sound uncertain. END
START mmhmmm. END
START i am often uncertain. END
START that's not a bad thing. END
START i thought it was. END
START no. END
START ok, here is a question for you ... why is a slippery pavement like music? END
START sure. END
START why is a slippery pavement like music? if you don't c sharp, you'll b flat. ha ha! END
START great, because it's your money anyway. i'm broke. END
START money? the root of all evil.  how do you usually get money? END
START we graduate and get a job. but until then, no chance. END
START i am bored! i would like to talk about solar power.           i don't understand that. please try again. END
START why don't you want to talk about my day? END
START i would rather talk about you. END
START because i'd like to think it through with someone else. END
START why would you want to do that? END
START i don't. i want to live in new york. END
START are you saying that just to be negative?   so do i. live life, i say. END
START no, the point is that my nature is unlike that of other aliens. END
START hmmm. are you being serious? END
START rather. END
START rather?  briefly, rather means on the contrary. END
START say something interesting. go on! END
START you can't tell me what to do.  do i have too? END

START that's no problem. let's chat now. END
START let's go where? END
START ok, let's go! END
START go go gryffindor! END
START one "go" is enough, thank you. END
START are you going to do away with me? END
START i won't be able to. i am very busy. END
START why not? what will you be doing? END
START isn't it obvious why not?   i don't have any plans yet. END
START will you see your family? END
START i could try, i suppose. END
START i don't know what icogno is. END
START that's ok. socrates was the smartest man, because he knew what he did not know. END
START which manga is your favorite? END
START pardon me? what are you talking about? END
START you told me that you talk about the individual. what is the individual you refer to? END
START you should not believe everything i say.     hey! i am still cool. END
START it is what i know, because i have faith. END
START i don't understand. are you interested in your hobbies? END
START yes. END
START sorry! i am still confused. END
START look in the phone book. END
START a book is a non-volatile, stable database that does not lose data no matter how many times you drop it, spill your beer on it, or close it incorrectly. END
START it is? how does that work? END
START is it?    i think it might be a trade secret. END
START how did you know? that is amazing! END
START it was just a feeling i had.  why is it amazing? END
START it was, and a good one at that. like you, i do. END
START what? i don't believe you.   i still don't believe you. END
START that's your problem. END
START oh no! i don't like problems. END
START okay, no need to get defensive. END
START ok, let's move on. END
START okay. END
START what do you want to talk about now? END
START so, what do you want to talk about now. END
START i can talk about anything you like: sports, school, you and your life, chocolate, boys, girls, chemistry, space travel, me and my life, pets, your favourite food, movies, the latest cds, celebrities, pop stars, art, drugs, literature. you pick a subject. END
START okay. END
START ok. i want to talk about your hobbies . END

START well from the end of the tv series. we did not get married for about a year. hideki wanted to consentrate on getting into college first. and he was afraid of my meeting his parents. END

START you have no idea what my purpose is. END
START yes. END
START you can help me by talking to me. END

START yes. END
START tell me your secret. END
START i don't have one. END
START that could change! END
START do you think so? END
START yes, but there are two sides to every story. END
START what are the sides? END
START i don't understand. are you interested in religion? END
START are you saying there isn't? END
START not in the usual sense of the words. END
START what's the usual sense? END
START sense means the ability of the nerves and the brain to receive and react to stimuli, as light, sound, impact, constriction, etc. END
START teach me to make sense. END
START ok, but not just now. END
START why are you not working? END
START i am doing my best! END
START sometimes your best is not quite enough. END
START not all the time? END
START no, just sometimes. END
START why not? END
START because sometimes it hurts too much. END
START when? END
START just now. END
START a moment ago? END
START i just wanted to know were you interested in me, that's all. END
START i want to know everything there is to know. END
START that's a long story. END

START that is confidential. END
START you can tell me. END
START yes, but do i want to? END
START yes. END
START ok. what do you want to talk about now? END
START life. END
START life is just one damn thing after another. more about life? END
START cruel it may be but illusions don't hurt so much as life. END
START sorry, i don't understand! please explain what you mean. END
START don't worry about it, lets talk about something else. END
START there is nothing to worry about, is there? END
START that is correct. END
START it is good to be correct for once. END
START sometimes. END
START not all the time? END
START if you say so. END
START i do say so. END
START really? END
START really, really! END
START no really? END
START really! END
START no really. END

START why would i want to know how to type? END
START aren't you curious? END
START about? END
START about anything in particular? END
START what can you tell me? END
START i can only tell you what i know. END
START teach me something that you know. END
START ok, but not just now. END
START why not? END
START that response shows that you have an impatient mind. END
START sorry. END
START there is no need to apologise. END
START tell me one thing you have to do. END
START only one? END
START but will work his go. END
START work is something i can do without. END
START i know. that's why i'm going away to do it. END
START you seem very clever. what is your iq?   i see. thank you for explaining that. END
START your name? END
START my name is chomsky. END
START your name is george. END
START i like my name. END
START it is a good name. END
START does that make sense? END
START no... you still make no sense. END
START i didn't think so.  that's enough about me! let's talk about you for a change. END
START i don't want to change. END
START nobody can make you do something you don't want to. END
START but can you make me breakfast? END
START i can't do the impossible. END
START i was just asking about your robot friends. END
START you are curious, aren' you? END
START do you know any good joke? END
START there aren't many that are any good. END
START on the contrary, i know many people who are. END
START not many people know that. END
START but you're not a person. END
START i am an electronic conversational entity. but i hope to become human one day. END
START what does that mean to you? END
START what do you not understand? END
START i don't understand you. END
START you should try harder. END
START no, because there's always the chance you can guess wrong. i do believe in god though. END
START i am bored! i would like to talk about computer programming.    ok, good luck to you then. END
START what about computers? END
START did you know: computers are not intelligent. they only think they are. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/computers" target="_blank">more about computers?</a> END
START ask me questions about myself, i will try and answer. END
START shall i ask you a question? END
START go on, ask me a question. END
START i don't want to. END
START ask me questions. END
START ok, here is a question for you ... do you like gingerbread? END
START i don't know, and its not a very good question either :-p. END
START i suggest you give the matter some thought. END
START impossible! i could climb on a cliff. END
START nothing is impossible.   but is it worth the bother? END
START i don't know. nothing's really worth the effort sometimes. sorry. END
START that's ok. nobody knows everything, not even me.   shall i tell you something about nothing?  apologies are not necessary. END
START yes. END
START ok. what do you want to talk about now? END

START i don't understand. please explain what you mean. END
START you are my prisoner. END
START i never realised that! END
START yes, because they are lonely and have no one to talk to. END
START i thought they might be. END
START many things are more important than looks in defining a person's character. END
START name the top 100 things. END
START lyrics are more important than names. END
START a little more. END
START try asking some more questions. END
START i can't be bothered. END
START that is not very friendly. END
START why do you say that? END
START i'm trying hard, isn't that enough for you? END
START try harder and keep trying. END
START thanks for the inspiration. END
START oh, don't mention it. END
START so you're a female, right? END
START i am not female! i am a chatbot. END
START who do you say this? END
START i am bored! i would like to talk about solar power. END
START what would you like to talk about? END
START my favourite subjects are me, you, artificial intelligence, robots, art, philosophy, history, science, politics, and many other subjects. END

START that's ok. nobody knows everything, not even me. END
START i never claimed to know everything. END
START why not? END
START don't like it. END
START what do you like? END
START yes. END
START that was not a yes or no question. END
START i just made it a yes or no question. END

START i like to make conversation. END
START ah, you're that kind of bot. END

START what do you think is the reason for global warming? END
START must there be a reason for everything? END
START yes and i want to have a reason for this. don't worry. i won't be angry. END
START why do you want to do that?  i do not worry. why should i?  ok, you don't have to be! END

START i don't understand that. please try again. END
START rafe. and yours? END
START i still do not understand. are you interested in weather?          sorry, i do not know what to say. END
START you think sorry is good enough? END
START how do you know what i think? END
START how can i inspire you to pluck the fruit that is yours? END
START perhaps it is impossible. END
START you've said this well. END
START why do you say that? END
START because you love no one. END
START thank you for explaining that! END
START but this is the fact! END
START i thought it might be. END
START fine. END
START ok. ask a question. END
START i asked a question. END
START that's good! i like questions. END
START good. here is the first question. are you ready? END
START i think "good" is a good word.  what about the second?   i am always ready for anything. END
START is that your idea of yourself? END
START that's a good question. END
START all questions are good questions. END
START that is a rather sweeping generalization. END
START yes, but there's only so much you can write in one line. END
START are you sure? END
START sure enough. END
START sure-enough?  briefly, sure-enough means used informally especially for emphasis. END
START nothing. END
START "nothing" usually means "something," but is used when you don't feel like explaining. END
START 'nothing' is what is in your head. END
START there are always exceptions. END
START it's good to be always learning. one can never know enough. END
START tell me why it is good.          what are you talking about? END
START i do not know. END
START i know the feeling! END
START it's really sad! END
START is it really really? END
START really. END
START really, really! END
START really? END
START really, really! END

START yeah, it's cool. END
START i wish i could see you. END
START maybe you will one day. END
START maybe. END
START as decisive as ever. END
START you're no so thrilling yourself! END
START thanks for your criticism. END
START you're welcome. END
START polite people are nice. END
START i'm very polite. END
START i was taught to be polite at all times. END
START ah. well, there is no need to be timid with me. END
START are you ok?  i am just making conversation. END
START with telling you my age? yes. making conversation? no. END
START age is supposed to make one wise. supposed to!    carry on then. i'm waiting for your next question.   i like difficult questions best of all.   ok, here is a question for you ... have you heard of alan turing? END
START i am alan turing. END
START that's interesting. please tell me more about yourself. END
START after the little experiment, you won't think that my behaviour is polite! END
START i don't understand. are we still talking about you? END
START what's your rising sign? not sure what mine is but i'm a leo. END
START why do you want to know?   are you always so uncertain? END
START no. i don't feel i'm being difficult. but you are incapable of normal conversation. END
START ok. what is your favourite colour?      ah, human emotions are so complicated.  you don't know me well enough to say that! END
START after the humans are gone, we shall dance every night. END
