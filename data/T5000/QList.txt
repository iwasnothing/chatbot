START are you sure? END
START sure enough. END
START sure-enough?  briefly, sure-enough means used informally especially for emphasis. END
START nothing. END

START i was taught to be polite at all times. END
START ah. well, there is no need to be timid with me. END
START are you ok?  i am just making conversation. END
START with telling you my age? yes. making conversation? no. END

START i am alan turing. END
START that's interesting. please tell me more about yourself. END
START after the little experiment, you won't think that my behaviour is polite! END
START i don't understand. are we still talking about you? END
START what's your rising sign? not sure what mine is but i'm a leo. END
START why do you want to know?   are you always so uncertain? END
START no. i don't feel i'm being difficult. but you are incapable of normal conversation. END
START ok. what is your favourite colour?      ah, human emotions are so complicated.  you don't know me well enough to say that! END
START after the humans are gone, we shall dance every night. END
