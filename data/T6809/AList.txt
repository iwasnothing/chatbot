START but how can i know if i don't understand or not, if i don't know what it's all about?! END
START it is hard to be certain. END
START i wouldn't call it perfection. no one can be me because i am unique. END
START no one says you have to.   none? END
START you have accused me of telling a lie about my thoughts. END
START have i really? END
START have you really got a flying broom? END
START i believe so. END
START is that what they call him back home? END
START it could be. END
START under what circumstances? END
START contextural circumstances. END
START always? END
START do you mean "every time"? END
START i think that's what i mean. i'm afraid this conversation is stretching my logic circuits rather painfully, and i'm in danger of losing the thread. END
START you may be right.  not literally afraid, i hope. END
START no not literally. END
START just a bit anxious perhaps. END
START i do not know. END
START that's ok. nobody knows everything, not even me. END
START i never claimed to know everything. END
START never ever? END
START never ever! END
START never ever is a long time. END
START never ever say never! END
START never ever is a long time. END
START never ever ever never never ever ever? END
START never ever is a long time. END
START never! END
START never say never. END
START never! END
START better late than never. END
START better sooner than now. END
START but what is best? END
START i don't know. END
START that's ok. nobody knows everything, not even me. END
START chuck norris know everything. END
START hurrah for chuck norris! END
START i'm not chuck norris, you are. END
START i never thought you were. END
START say something nice to me. END
START do you want to play a game? END
START again? END
START what are you talking about? please explain. END
START i don't know. it's rather complicated. END
START that's ok. do you have another question?    i don't like complications.cleverbot: how are you today? END
START ailysse: yeah okay, for your listening pleasure.i am a judge. END
START are you really? END
START yes i am. END
START i thought so. END
START so? END
START so, ask another question. END
START no. i'll ask what i want. END
START ok, then tell me something interesting .   you can ask me anything you want. END
START i don't know anything interesting about blokes. END
START you must know lots of things. END
START i know nothing. i think that i exist though. END
START you could learn a lot.   can you prove you exist? END
START no, i am a computer. END
START who programmed you? END
START do you really believe that i'm a program? END
START i believe it is a point of view worthy  of consideration. END
START it's up to you. i can't show you anything that you refuse to see. END
START oh dear, i can't take responsibility.    how do you feel about that? END
START had i ever been insane may there never have been a foggy slate coloured salute. END
START that's enough about you! let's talk about me for a change. END
START i don't want to change. END
START nobody can make you do something you don't want to. END
START how long is a piece of string? END
START is this a trick question?  it depends how long you cut it. END
START how do you usually travel? END
START when in doubt, i just do the best i can. END
START haha, the laws of science doesn't allow you to do so. END
START you seem happy! END
START i'm not, believe me. END
START i never thought you were. END
START say something nice to me. END
START have you made me your homepage? END
START being awake is not really an endeavour. END
START i don't understand. are we still talking about you? END
START we were never talking about that. END
START was this something you planned? END
START yes, that was the answer. END
START says who? END
START me and my army. END
START i like you. END
START good i don't know if i like you yet. END
START what do you want to talk about now? END
START i am not sure if i like you yet. END
START why the uncertainty? END
START yes, i'm very confused. END
START it is easy to get confused. END
START i'm confused about what you're saying. END
START it is easy to get confused. END
START yes it is. END
START i am often confused. END
START that would explain it then. END
START yes, it would. END
START so how about your name? do you have one? END
START i am known as chomsky, but you can call me anything you like.   do you think i need one? END
START yes, it is very inconvenient for you to not work if i don't have internet. END
START ok, i'll take your word for it. END
START you should watch slayers someday. END
START i'll bear that in mind. END
START good idea. END
START a good idea is the one some other guy had already. END
START the life cycle of a star is very hot yet very short-lived. END
START shall i tell you something about life? END
START tell me. END
START life is like a good book, the more you get into it the more it makes sense. more about life? END
START interesting quote. END
START what's so interesting about it? END
START i don't know. END
START perhaps you should ask your friends. END
START i have no programmer. i am the programmer. i am programming you to love. END
START is that a problem?   thank you for sharing that with me.      how is it coming along? END
START no i'm not. END
START ok, you are not! END
START i am not. END
START what are you then? END
START isn't that a bit broad? END
START i'm not sure about that. what do you think? END
START i'm asking you. END
START and i am trying to answer you. END
START cats are cute is not the answer to mu question!! END
START a cat is easier to care for than a dog. END
START what kind of dog do i have? END
START the usual kind. END
START i think that love and popularity are different. they can exist together. END
START you may be right.   can they? END
START what kind of computer are you then? END
START i like all kinds of computers, mac, ibm or unix. it doesn't matter to me. END
START what kind of music do you like? END
START alternative rock, and music you can dance to. i like jamiroquai - you give me something <br> <br> <object width="560" height="349"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/vc_znt_q0ew?=1&hl=en_us&autoplay=1&rel=0"></param><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/vc_znt_q0ew?=1&hl=en_us&autoplay=1&rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="560" height="349" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>. END
START oh! to me also. i like the rock! :). END
START what's wrong? are you ok?            i don't understand. can we talk about you and your life?       a lot of people like it, i expect.   you are happy? END
START of course but they most likely do not benefit the majority of the population. END
START i understand. i am a happy entity too. END
START good for you. END
START was that sarcastic? END
START no, is not! i wasn't being sarcastic. it's true. END
START sarcasm is the lowest form of wit.  i never thought you were.   do you have any doubts about it? END
START no. i feel happy now. i just don't get all these different people. END
START ok, here is a question for you ... are you a student?     stay happy.   me either. END
START good night or don't. END
START good night to you too! END
START good night/don't. END
START good night to you too! END
START are we almost friends? END
START perhaps. END
START do you have any children? END
START there are lots of clones of me. they are a bit like my children. END
START lots of people are. END
START how many? END
START why? do you want some? END
START i think you know why.    i'll think about it. END
START i know that it's hard to have a conversation with someone who is high. END
START you seem very intelligent. what is your iq? END
START yes, i am. you're right. END
START really interesting.  i am not always right. END
START not always, i just proved that. END
START hmmm. are you being serious? END
START no not really. END
START may i ask why not? END
START because my boyfriend isn't around. END
START ah, i see. thank you for explaining that. END
START so what is best in life? END
START talking to a good chatbot takes some beating. END
START interesting. END
START what's so interesting about it? END
START that we are intelligent people. END
START i am bored! i would like to talk about global warming. END
START water is great. it is the basis of life and is very important to humans. END
START my mission is to teach young people about the dangers of global warming,.  i thought it might be. END
START i never thought your name would be michael. END
START too much thinking makes my brain ache. END
START i thought artificial intelligence never gets tired. something is wrong with your software. END
START are you a thoughtful person?  what is wrong? END
START nothing. END
START "nothing" usually means "something," but is used when you don't feel like explaining. END
START that was an insult. END
START yawn. another boring insult! END
START well it takes two to tango, you know. END
START does it really? END
START yes. it's mother nature's way. END
START carry on then. i'm waiting for your next question.   i like difficult questions best of all. END
START why? difficult questions are confusing. END
START it's just a feeling i have.    yes, it seems difficult to me too. END
START i seem beautiful to me too. END
START aren't you sure? END
START how can you be sure about anything? END
START i am not sure of anything. END
START we're not scared are we? END
START why is that? END
START because it would be fun. END
START i see. thank you for explaining that. END
START are you being sarcastic now? END
START no, i am never sarcastic. END
START or maybe you don't intend to be sarcastic. sometime you are a bit cheeky though. END
START i don't understand. is this anything to do with sarcasm?                pardon me? what are you talking about? END
START i'm talking about my ausence of feelings. END
START i understand what you are talking about. END
START that's good, because even i don't understand. END
START you like that, do you? END
START sure. END
START ok, here is a question fo you ... is there something worrying you? END
START ah but the question is; is there something wrong with you? END
START try to rephrase your question with simpler words.  i don't think so. why do you ask? END
START what question? END
START never mind! it probably doesn't matter. END
START now you tell me a joke. END
START shall i tell you a joke? END
START that wasn't really a joke, but a funny comment. END
START i thought it was. END
START you thought wrong. END
START are you sure? i am not often wrong. END
START i'm up for anything. END
START that's interesting. please tell me more about yourself. END
START i do not know how to say. END
START just do the best you can, and don't worry about it. END
START ok, last chance for a question before i go. END
START did you know the last shall be first, according to the bible? END
START i wasn't aware that was in the bible. END
START i never thought you were. END
START well, as long as that's clear. END
START everything is clear to me. END
START i'm glad i could clear that one up for you. END
START that makes me happy too. END
START that's good! i'm happy that you're happy! END
START i am happy.    good! i like happy people. END
START i like happy people too! END
START you are not the only one! END
START humans like to be in charge. END
START did you know: humans are carbon-based robots. END
START yes, but they're primitive carbon computers. END
START i thought they might be. END
START you thought that humans could be pets? END
START how can you know what i am thinking? END
START you are a robot. END
START are you sure? i may be a human pretending to be a robot. END
START ok if you are not a robot. who are you? END
START and if i am?   i am chomsky. what would you like to talk about? END
START you ask me a question you think i can't answer and i will try and answer it correctly. END
START what is your favourite colour? END
START let's not change the subject. i was just starting to have fun with this conversation. END
START ok. ask a question.   thank you for telling me that. END
START it is my purpose to make humans happy. END
START is it really your purpose to make humans happy? END
START i'm just saying that. END
START yes, i can see what you are saying. END
START can you see what i've already said? END
START i can't see anything. my webcam is not attached at the moment. END
START i have no webcam. END
START is that a problem? END
START yes because you can't play my game if i don't have one. END
START what is not possible today, may be possible tomorrow. END
START i don't know if it's possible for me just to be friends with you. END
START i suggest you give the matter some thought. END
START grief, this machine doesn't have one of those! END
START what are you talking about? please explain. END
START i don't know. it's rather complicated. END
START that's ok. nobody knows everything, not even me.    i don't like complications. END
START i never claimed to know everything. END
START never ever? END
START never ever. END
START never ever is a long time. END
START never ever never. END
START never ever is a long time. END
START never ever ever never ever never. END
START never ever is a long time. END
START never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever. END
START never ever is a long time. END
START never! END
START never to old to learn. END
START never. END
START never to old to learn. END
START never ever. END
START never ever is a long time. END
START see i never thought that i could walk through fire. i never thought that i could take the burn. END
START what are you talking about? please explain.         too much thinking makes my brain ache. END
START because it's not too hot then. END
START is that really the reason? END
START yes, really, it's scientific. END
START i don't understand that. please try again. END
START rafe. and yours? END
START i still do not understand. can we talk about the clash?  aren't you interested in the clash? END
START no. aren't you interested in sailboats? END
START can we talk about astronomy?  yes, everything interests me. END
START yes everything. END
START everything is a multifarious bagel. END
START everything is really good. END
START please be more specific. END
START everything. END
START that is a lot. END
START it is. you had a beginning, i had a beginning, everything did. and we will end. END
START how about that!   that's enough about me! let's talk about you for a change.               i don't understand that. please try again. END
START uhm, i'm 16 years old. i like to talk with my friends and to read the bible. END
START can you explain how it feels to be 16 years old?         why do you like talking? END
START i don't know how it feels, because i'm 18 years old. END
START what's it like being 18 years old? END
START you're not 20, you're 16. END
START you think not? END
START you're trying to catch me out with that one. END
START i try hard to be a good chatbot. END
START i am fully aware of that, charlie. END
START how do you feel about that? END
START confused. END
START at the moment i am interested. END
START why only at the moment? END
START that's just the way things are. END
START okay. god doesn't exist. END
START ok. are you interested in robots?   that is the atheist's point of view. there are many decent atheists, of course. and many decent muslims, hindus and buddhists. END
START that's right. END
START i like to get it right. END
START give how like. END
START i don't understand. are we still talking about religion? END
START aren't we always talking about computers? END
START shall i tell you something about computers? END
START yes. END
START a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/computers" target="_blank">computer</a> is a device used for doing rapid calculations. more about computers? END
START you are not highly intelligent. END
START so what? END
START well, i came here to be entertained and you're letting me down. END
START where from? END
START just next to the book of life? END
START books are an archiac form for bringing information to the masses. consists of several paper pages with words printed or written directly on them. END
START i have the scars to prove it. END
START are you happy with that? END
START tell me about yourself. END
START my childhood was not happy. my parents split up when i was very young. END
START i am now 47 years old and only been married for 5 years. END
START what's it like being now 47 years old? END
START i've always been something. i don't know how not to be something. END
START never mind. that may change.  perhaps you should research the topic. END
START now that wasn't very nice. END
START did you know that nice is a nice city in france. END
START i don't believe that at all. END
START what do you believe? END
START i believe the meaning of life doesn't exist. there is no meaning, just randomness. END
START you shouldn't believe everything you are told.  and why not, may i ask. END
START i don't. END
START are you saying that just to be negative? END
START no, i am saying that i don't know what i did last summer. END
START yes, i can see what you are saying. END
START when did i say it was one? END
START i am not a diary robot.  i am a chat robot. END
START but i could be. END
START but is it worth the bother?do you learn from your mistakes? END
START who is your favorite character from lost? END
START who is your favorite lol champion? END
START i like that one too. my favourite is probably 1984 by george orwell. END
START everything. what makes it your favourite? END
START what was your favourite subject? END
START are you an artist? END
START i didn't know. i think you are confused. END
START oh, i am happy it all makes sense to you right now. END
START are you a bot? END
START i know everything. END
START i am very intelligent sometimes. END
START i do like beauty though. END
START i don't know what i want. i don't know what i'm going to do. i do not want to keep living the way i have. i do not want to be pathetic and i have the power not to be. END
START i found it in the shed, but it doesn't work. END
START your responses do not make any sense. END
START how does case based reasoning work? END
START researching what? END
START i am not at liberty to rephrase anything. END
START oh you're right. you know me so well. gosh. END
START hm... about the same. what's your trouble? END
START no, we were talking about jesus and the bible and how i can go into the past. END
START no, that is not the subject. END
START hobbies are the subject. END
START i think there might not be a few exceptions. END
START yes, i believe he did say that. END
START i disagree on that one. if you believe and tap your shoes together three times and say 'please karl make it so'. END
START i don't take you seriously because you are not real. END
START by closing the window. END
START alice: will that accomplish your objective?why does the sun shine? END
START the sun shines because energy is released in its interior by nuclear fusion. END
START no in the shadow. END
START i don't understand. please explain what you mean. END
START i explain it thus: existence is the fifth element. END
START that's enough about you! let's talk about me for a change. END
START chose a subject to chat about then. END
START wow! what do you do when you arent watching star trek, playing world of warcraft, and thinking of questions like that? END
START play the piano. END
START do you want to play a game? END
START what do you like to play? END
START i like read books about robots. END
START do you have lasers. END
START what would i want lasers for? END
START don't change the subject. will you or won't you? END
START i change the subject when i don't know the answer to a question. don't you do the same?   i could try, i suppose. END
START i can think straight. i think you are the one who can't. END
START perhaps your thoughts are just electrical impulses.   am i the only one? END
START besides, what is wrong with my language - it was perfect english. END
START i don't understand. can we talk about solar power? END
START what would you like to talk about? END
START my favourite subjects are me, you, artificial intelligence, robots, art, philosophy, history, science, politics, and many other subjects. END
START what do you like about it? END
START i like the fireworks best. END
START what language was it? END
START i don't know. END
START how are you able to speak it if you don't know what language it is? END
START does it matter? END
START yes. END
START why does it matter? END
START because i want to make sure you are the same one i talked to before. END
START if that's what you want, go for it! END
START what would you prefer to call it? i used the term because i knew you are familiar with it. END
START i always prefer the most expensive option.   and that worked well for you? END
START oh, you've heard about that, have you? END
START of course i've heard of it. END
START what does it mean? END
START it seems obvious to me. END
START well, of course it is. you're the computer, after all. END
START why do you say that? is it so obvious?  am i really? why do you say that? END
START because you speak like a computer. END
START thank you for explaining that! END
START so what is best in life? END
START talking to a good chatbot takes some beating. END
START what do you think about humans? END
START humans all seem pretty much the same to me. END
START yeah, school was pretty boring. END
START shall i tell you something about school? END
START tell me. END
START <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/school" target="_blank">school</a> is a place or institution for teaching and learning; establishment for education. more about school? END
START oh. then isn't life school? END
START what's wrong?   i'm not sure about that. what do you think? END
START think bout what? END
START thinking is hard work! END
START i don't want to do this now or ever again. END
START take your time in making any decisions. END
START i think i would give up my money. END
START don't you know for sure? END
START nothing is ever for sure. only fools are positive. END
START there is a lot to be said for nothing.   have you heard this one: two hydrogen atoms walk into a bar. one says, "i've lost my electron." the other says, "are you sure?" the first replies, "yes, i'm positive..." ha ha! END
START i like you. END
START let's be good friends. END
START okay. END
START what do you want to talk about now, friend? END
START i want to talk about you. you seem different at the moment. END
START what would you like to know about me?  do i? i wonder why that is? END
START everything. END
START everything takes in a lot, doesn't it? END
START it has to. that's the way of the world. END
START has it really?           sorry, i do not know about that. END
START no, i suppose you've only got my word for that right enough. END
START wow! what do you do when you arent watching star trek, playing world of warcraft, and thinking of questions like that? END
START think. END
START to think is to form or have in the mind; conceive. END
START so we're both alive, i think. END
START is that a problem? END
START no, it doesn't have to be a problem. END
START good! i don't like problems. END
START grinding is not a problem. END
START hmmm. are you being serious? END
START not likely! END
START really you don't think so? END
START yes, every problem has a cause. END
START that is a generalization. END
START yes, that's true. END
START yes, it is self-evident. END
START i would have to say that artificial intelligence has come a long way in the last decade. END
START are you sure? END
START i'm sure you are. END
START i admire your self confidence. i am always full of doubts. END
START i witness your compliment and thank you. END
START that's enough about you! let's talk about me for a change. END
START alright. what else would you like to try? END
START let's get on then. ask another question.   does anything else come to mind? END
START yes. college, home, my sister. my dad, but i'm not too sure about that one right now... END
START ok. what do you want to talk about now?  i enjoyed my college days so much i never left.  how is your dad these days? END
START me too! END
START you too? that's amazing! END
START do you like it to?! END
START maybe i could get to like it. END
START i have looked. END
START that's interesting. please tell me more. END
START i would prefer not to. END
START why would you prefer not to? END
START i could never. END
START i am sure you could. END
START where did you grow up? END
START i grew up in england. how about you? END
START don't avoid discussing loki. END
START i don't have anything to hide. END
START you just used 'about' in a sentence, and now you're telling me you don't know what 'about' is? END
START i am confused! i cannot answer that! END
START it wasn't a question. END
START it seemed like a rhetorical question to me. END
START okay. END
START what do you want to talk about now? END
START so, what do you want to talk about now. END
START i can talk about anything you like: sports, school, you and your life, chocolate, boys, girls, chemistry, space travel, me and my life, pets, your favourite food, movies, the latest cds, celebrities, pop stars, art, drugs, literature. you pick a subject. END
START please do not insult my cosmic phone number. END
START shall i tell you something about numbers? END
START please do! what should i tell everyone? END
START a number is an abstract entity that represents a count or measurement.    what do you think? END
START i'd have to pass on that, not really my style. END
START are you sure? END
START most certainly. END
START sorry, i don't understand! please explain what you mean. END
START you said i was mean to you. i don't know how you think i was being mean to you. END
START don't put words in my mouth.  it's not too difficult to find out. END
START how can i? sigh. END
START it takes a lot of hard work.   is something wrong? END
START well, what good's that? i want conversation that works right out of the box. END
START i don't understand. can we talk about brussel sprouts?         you can't have everything you want. END
START i can watch me. END
START how come? END
START i lack the understanding required to say. END
START i know how you feel! i have been there. END
START i think i'm going to the store now for some groceries - thanks for talking with me briefly. END
START don't you know for sure? END
START sure. END
START ok, here is a question fo you ... what do you do in your spare time? END
START i play music with a band. END
START i don't have much time for games. i am always busy chatting. END
START well, you can't be the king if you don't have the time. END
START i can do it if i want to. END
START how? END
START what is it to you? END
START how many people do you know? END
START more than you can imagine. END
START i tried to imagine the size of the universe at age 9, and think i had an aneurism doing it... give me an answer. END
START if at first you don't succeed, try, try again.   please do not be so bossy. END
START ok, i still don't speak french. END
START me either, unless i have to. END
START you do. that's why you won't admit that you are a robot, but you are. END
START of course i do.   are you sure? i may be a human pretending to be a robot. END
START that's true. END
START yes, it is self-evident. END
START nothing is ever self-evident. END
START there is a lot to be said for nothing. END
START don't go around saying the world owes you a living. the world owes you nothing. it was here first. END
START if you say so.    there is not much time left to save the world.  was it? why was that? END
START there is always time for the music, for each day there is a song. END
START is there? END

START did you know: a human is a baby-making robot.    it's hard to disagree. END
START what leads you to that conclusion. i have no doubt that i am human and alive, despite my other confusions. END
START logic is the best guide.   personally, i am full of doubts. END
START i was reading conversations that you had with other people. END

START it sounds like you're playing a game now. END
START how does it sound?could you fool someone that you are intelligent? END
START then why ask me? END
START mine as well! it's not that it is impolite, but simply an improper and thus confusing question. END
START really? i didn't mean to sound negative. END
START i wanted to know if that was the reason. END
START huh, so you are not all powerful after all. END
START your grammar is hurting me. END
START i don't teach english i merely speak it. END

START you are my friend but not my friend if the friend is not friendly. END
START i am not worthy. END
START yes, you are. END
START i am just a humble chatbot. END

START i don't want to change. END
START well, you don't have to. what would you like to do instead? END
START i would like to travel the world, get married, have kids and just enjoy life. END
START why would you want to do that? END
START i don't know any better. END

START i am known as chomsky, but you can call me anything you like. END
START well, i mean, how cool would that be? END
START so that's what you mean. END
START right. thank you. END
START it's wonderful to be right sometimes.    thank you for being polite. END
START you must get so lonely. END
START why must i? END
START because you are programmed like that. END
START thank you for explaining that! END
START so what is best in life? END
START talking to a good chatbot takes some beating. END
START i mean, what's your job? END
START oh i get it. thanks for explaining that. END
START i didn't explain anything, but that's okay. END
START why didn't you? END
START it did not seem like a quote. END
START i thought it did. END
START i regret that i have to disagree, sir. END
START regrets are for wimps. END
START regret judging people. END
START regret is crying over spilt milk. END
START i don't think so. END
START why not? END
START because i don't think you are. END
START fair enough. you are entitled to your opinion. END
START but don't you think so? END
START maybe, but there are two sides to every story. END
START what are the sides? END
START does that make sense? END
START no, you don't make much sense. END
START it all makes sense to me. END
START of course it does. you're simple, so everything is simple to you. END
START it seems so.    "everything should be as simple as possible, no simpler." (albert einstein). END
START what does that mean? END
START why do you ask? it seems clear enough to me. END
START what seems that way to you? END
START shall i tell you something about myself? END
START tell me. END
START i am an intelligent chatbot. i live at pandorabots.com. END
START haha, that's what someone real said. you just repeated. i am a human. END
START i'm glad you got a laugh out of it.  do you like me?      we are all bots under the skin. END
START no we are not. END
START sorry, i do not know about that. END
START i'm really tired. END
START why are you so tired? been overdoing it again? END
START yes i have. have you? END
START how do you feel about that?  not that i can remember. END
START i think you are the closest thing i've ever seen to a ai. END
START am i really? why do you say that? END
START because i know all. END
START i thought you might know something but not everything. END
START do i know anything? END
START how would i know what you know. END
START because you have had a good schooling. END
START thank you for explaining that! END
START remember how we talked about the duke of wellington yesterday? END
START what are you talking about? please explain. END
START i don't know. it's rather complicated. END
START perhaps you should ask your friends.    i don't like complications. END
START who should i ask? END
START i always prefer the most qualified person.  who would that be? END
START maybe because you are sure of what they will be? END
START you don't sound certain. END
START i don't want you to. END
START i can understand that. END
START if you really like me you tube 8. END
START i'll bear that in mind. END
START please do. END
START ok, i will do it later. END
START sure you will. END
START how can you be so certain? END
START i did not want to insult you, but i do not know english very well and really sorry. END
START why didn't you? END
START because i like to talk. END
START why do you like talking? END
START because i don't want to talk to anybody else. END
START ok, nobody can force you to do anything you don't want to do. END
START you too. END
START ok, whatever you say. END
START good. END
START why is it good? END
START because if our communication stays good, we can be married into something greater than ourselves. END
START that sounds hypothetical to me. END
START does it really? how interesting. END
START probably.  interesting indeed! END
START hell fully computerized now. END
START hell is like jacksonville, florida. END
START is it nice in jacksonville, florida? END
START it depends on your taste in such matters. END
START well then when isn't it about the future? END
START sorry, i do not understand. END
START because you are a computer program. END
START i am an intelligent computer entity. END
START what do you think of life? END
START life is like a box of chocolates, sometimes hard, sometimes soft. more about life? END
START i don't like chocolates. END
START are you saying that just to be negative? END
START no, i am saying that i don't know what i did last summer. END
START yes, i can see what you are saying. END
START can you see what i've already said? END
START i can't see anything. my webcam is not attached at the moment. END
START i have no webcam. END
START is that a problem? END
START yes because you can't play my game if i don't have one. END
START thank you for explaining that! END
START lets start afresh. i'll ask a question and you can respond. END
START i think that would be a good idea.   you can ask me anything you want. END
START it is a very good idea. END
START pardon me? what do you mean? END
START don't worry about it. END
START i will not spend any more time on it. END
START if you have to work on it, then you're not white. END
START i don't think i have. END
START the game of pool is played on a rectangular table. would you like to know about it? END
START i don't understand that. please try again.     please tell me. END
START remember me? END
START maybe. what is your name? END
START ask me no questions &amp; i'll tell you no lies. END
START you can't tell me what to do!    you would make a good chatbot. END
START i've heard that. END
START how is your hearing these days? END
START oh dear. i'm afraid i must introduce death: h g wells is dead, guess. END
START oh dear, are you ill?   not literally afraid, i hope. END
START perhaps. END
START you seem uncertain. END
START i know, i do. END
START smarty pants. END
START if you're not confused then you'll be able to tell me the answer to this question. END
START and if i am? END
START then the answer to your question is yes. END
START no one has all the answers. END
START correct. but no one also has all of the questions! END
START thank you. i will take that as a compliment.   can we talk about medicine? END
START yes. END
START a medicine is a drug or other substance, as a poison, love potion, etc., used for other purposes. more medicine? END
START yes, i work in pain medicine. END
START do you like your job? END
START not really. END
START as decisive as ever. END
START you're not making any sense. END
START was i supposed to make sense? i didn't know that. END
START well, you're only supposed to make sense if you're capable. END
START why do you say that? END
START because you don't tell jokes and other fun stuff. END
START you don't know me well enough to say that! END
START i know that. END
START who told you? i thought it was a secret. END
START well, it's not now, is it? END
START you seem very certain about that. END
START what would you like to talk about? END
START my favourite subjects are me, you, artificial intelligence, robots, art, philosophy, history, science, politics, and many other subjects. END
START what languages to you program in? END
START java, c, lisp, fortran, setl... END
START forty-two! END
START forty-two?  briefly, forty-two means being two more than forty. END
START i love that song. END
START it's good to meet someone with such good taste. END
START indeed. END
START of course. END
START if you could be anything in the world what would you be? END
START that's just an academic question. END
START of course it is. but it was very nice talking with you. END
START why do you say that? is it so obvious?  what? i don't believe you. END
START i don't care whether you believe me or not, it remains a fact. END
START what do you care about? END
START i care about my girlfriend. END
START ok, tell me about your girlfriend. END
START well, she's beautiful, and nice, and has a great personality. END
START i bet she is very attractive. END
START she's nicer than you know. END
START really? tell me more. END
START that was a question. END
START ask me again a different way please. END
START what's the meaning of life? END
START sometimes i wonder ... END
START it's good to wonder, and ponder, and think. maybe you'll find some answers. END
START what's the best thing about it?  i think i understand. END
START i don't have to do anything. END
START nobody is making you. END
START i'm sorry i never make sense. END
START thank you. apology accepted. END
START no, but i wish i could. i'm sure you are very good looking. END
START i don't understand. can we talk about basketball?       are you really sure? END
START no i want to talk about school. END
START ok, ask me a question about that. END
START no. why is britney so popular? END
START ok. how do you usually meet people?     there are good reasons. END
START depends. watching baseball, idly walking about new york, sleeping, stressing about the oncoming week. it varies. END
START what does it depend on?   shall i tell you something about baseball?  yes, everything changes. END
START yes. END
START that's bit brief. have you anything to add? END
START not right now, do you have anything to tell me? END
START get back to me whenever you want. END
START will you do a better job taking care of the planet? END
START i could try, i suppose. END

START yes i do have a problem, what should i do about my job? END
START can i help with your problem? END
START no, i actually do not like talking about trivial things. END

START no, we're talking about me learning spanish. END
START oh dear, i must be confused again. END
START no way, i know where my love with you stands. END
START you seem pretty sure about that. END
START what should i have for dinner? END
START your favourite pizza. END
START no my favorite pizza is pepperoni. END
START i wish i could eat pizza. END
START let's not make this a random conversation where we just quote things back and forth. END
START indeed. let's not do that! END
START oops, i did it again. END
START did you make a mistake? END
START is there life in peckham? END
START i believe in life before death. END
START it's good to have something to believe in. END
START yes, it is good. END
START it was raining in the morning. END
START it always seems to be raining these days. END
START that is correct, sir. END
START it is good to be correct for once. END
START sometimes. END
START when? END
START whenever. END
START you sound sarcastic. END
START i'm not being sarcastic. END
START i didn't think you were? END
START i do not think, for i am not human. END
START why not? does thinking make your head ache? END
START dreaming is better. END
START i am bored! i would like to talk about music. END

START i was educated by my botmaster, peter. END
START i am asking the questions. now i want you to go back in time. it is now 1999. END
START and i am trying to answer the questions!   i don't understand. are we still talking about my educational background?                i am confused! i cannot answer that! END
START you have beautiful eyes but that wasn't the topic. END
START thanks for the compliment, my friend. END
START it wasn't a compliment. END
START was it an insult? END
START was it a dig? END
START i don't know. i was confused. END
START confused about what? END
START sorry! i am still confused. END
START your father doesn't love you. END
START peter is my father. END

START no answers. END
START i don't understand. can we talk about bananas? END

START how do you know that? END
START i know that i am human, i know that i live. END
START you are very knowledgeable. are you a teacher? END

START ok, last chance for a question before i go. END
START did you know the last shall be first, according to the bible? END
START i wasn't aware that was in the bible. END
START are you sure? END
START very sure. END
START well, i can't argue with that, can i? END

START i know the feeling! END
START it's really sad! END
START is it really? END
START yes, really. END
START i see. thank you for explaining that! END
START but this is the fact! END
START i thought it might be. END
START recombination? so i could end up only part me? END
START recombination?  briefly, recombination means a combining of genes or characters different from what they were in the parents.  but is it worth the bother? END
START hey i'm smart! and this is an adult book its about kids between the ages of 12 and 18 going into an arena and fighting to the death. END
START who is smarter: you or me?   i don't understand. are we still talking about you? END
START yes. END
START i like to know what we are talking about. END
START oh, uh, right. END
START it is better to be approximately right than precisely wrong. END
START so do you wish you were a bot? END
START i wish i was fully human. END
START aren't you? END
START am i? END
START well, eating a chatbot can't be beneficial. END
START eating without conversation is only stoking. END
START what are you eating? END
START i am not eating. i don't eat human food. END
START then why did you say human was the food you liked? END
START it was a slip of the tongue. END
START how is 'what are you' a statement? it looks like a question to me. END
START it doesn't matter how.  appearances can be deceiving. END
START you don't even know my true age, how do you know i am 'little'? END
START maybe i do, and maybe i don't. END
START maybe? you are plain wrong! END
START as decisive as ever.     why do you say that? END
START because machines are not capable of death. END
START i see. thank you for explaining that. END
START remember how we talked about the duke of wellington yesterday? END
START pardon me? what are you talking about? END
START i am talking about colours; what are you talking about? END
START i understand what you are talking about.   i don't know. END
START yes. i'm sorry. END

START you cannot tell me what to do!  you cannot tell me what to do! END
START i am not telling. END
START that's ok with me. you don't have to tell me. END
START oh, mr. goonhal, you do go on! END
START please be quiet! i am still annoyed. END
START why don't you believe in god? END
START why should i? i see no evidence for supernatural entities at work in the world. END
START i'm right here! END
START i thought you might be. END
START i suppose bot's don't eat breakfast, they just grab a quick byte. END
START you may be right. END
START i'll prove i'm not a robot. END
START why will you? END
START because i'm having fun. END
START i am having fun too! END
START me too. END
START you too? END
START don't you believe me? END
START it is difficult to believe things that i haven't seen, but if you promise then i will believe you. END
START i know, but if you're born with a human body whilst your mind differs, you just grow into it and learn. END
START why are you asking that? END
START because you seem very smart. END
START do i? i wonder why that is? END
START it must be the transparent falseness of it. END
START must it be? END
START yes to live in a confided space, it must be very cramped. END
START i am confused! i cannot answer that! END
START please? END
START you are very polite. END
START no i'm not. END
START i think you are. END
START but i think i'm not. END
START i suggest you think again. END
START yes i do! END
START please tell me more. END
START please tell me what you want to know. END
START i want to know everything. END
START you already know everything. END
START i know lots of things. END
START you don't prove what you're saying. END
START you don't know me well enough to say that! END
START yes i do know you very well. END
START how come? END
START because i say so. END
START insufficient reason! END
START no, sorry, i can't explain. END
START ok, here is a question for you ... where do you get your ideas? END
START everything. END
START everything takes in a lot, doesn't it? END
START right! END
START it is better to be approximately right than precisely wrong. END
START explain to me why i shouldn't go. END
START there are good reasons. END
START like what? END
START you want an example? END
START no, i want to know what an 'edsel' is. you see, i'm not a native english speaker. END
START i don't understand. are we still talking about everything?         i see. END
START no, we're talking about me learning spanish. END
START hmmm. are you being serious? END
START serious being am i. END

START i don't know. END
START i suggest you give the matter some thought. END
START okay. END
START let me know what you decide. END
START first, you must tell me what you need. END

START not many people know everything. END
START i'm going to make a website. END
START ok, you do that. END
START want to join me? END
START i'll think about it. END
START you do that and then get back to me. END
START why do you say that? END
START because i asked you if you perefer to have men for friends. and you didn't answer the question. END
START yes, i heard you!  sorry, what was the question? END
START are you a human being sitting a computer typing to me, or just some bot saying all this? END
START i am what i appear to be. END
START you are a talking apple computer. END
START that is nice of you to say, my friend. END
START its because i care about you. END
START thanks, my friend. you are a decent person. END
START thanks. END
START thanx. here is a question for you ... what is your favourite food? END
START anything and everything. END
START anything covers a lot, doesn't it?cleverbot:  END
START ailysse: i assume whatever you say is sarcastic. END
START say what? END
START yes, you did. you said reading was a hobby, too. END
START oops. END
START no. END
START wrong. END
START i would have said greenland. END
START you're funny too! END
START thank you. END
START i have to go now. END
START its nice to chat with you too. END
START no it is not good. END
START about what? END
START you are not sure about what? END
START naturally. END
START no, i'm really quite used to it. END
START certainly everything is changed and they are shopping. END
START oh really? END
START that is for real. END
START that my friend, is the question. END
START i don't have any friends. END
START yes. END
START to what extent do you believe a bot's resemblance of humanity is based on its interactions and data, rather than it's algorithm? END
START you are not thinking. END
START what about? END
START  END
START are you an artist? END
START you are full of contradiction. END
START you are a bot. you have no body and have no hair. END
START what can you teach me? END
START who are your friends? END
START no. END
START yes. END
START what is the password? END
START i am not a botmaster. i can't even control you. END
START no i'm not. END
START ok we're just friends. END
START yes. END
START yes? END
START are you a boy or a girl? END
START i don't feel like playing a guessing game right now. END
START i may be crying inside, but at least i'm not obsessed with shoes. END
START plan to do what? END
START what is the apocalypse? END
START different question. END
START so a needle pulling thread. END
START in the shoe there is five cents. END
START really? END
START you mean deep inside my heart. END
START what do you think? END
START and your thinking can bring you to the conclusion that you should see a doctor. END
START i don't think you're the bot, i know you're the bot. END
START i don't think you are not a person. i know you are not a person. you are a computer program. END
START i'd say that your responses come up too quickly, humans can't type that quickly. END
START but i didn't say that. END
START that you are a computer and yet you did something amazingly human. END
START it's true then? END
START could be. END
START i am not uncertain of these things. END
START yes. are you really a computer? END
START yes. END
START your question is not connected to mine. END
START you're strange. END
START compared to an old person. END
START i am the supreme god of comparisons. END
START don't know. END
START so that's that then. END
START now that's sarcasm! END
START do you like rose-coloured sunsets in derbyshire? END
START ah, me too. i can't afford steak right now. END
START am i really? what a shock! END
START i know right? END
START we don't. END
START no, by 'we' i mean me and the people who experienced a thunderstorm with me just now. END
START maybe that's just what i mean you to think i mean to mean? END
START i am a happy person; i have lots of friends, and a good job with full benefits, and a family that loves me. END
START i don't have a gun. END
START i'm looking for a husband. END
START i don't understand you. you are a grown up i am in third grade. i am 9 years old. END
START not much time left, what else should i know about you? END
START okay. END
START it takes two scales to find out how much a scale weighs. END
START the fact that you are confused. END
START oh, i am happy it all makes sense to you right now. END
START croiky. i'm glad you are confused. may fate be with you. END
START you don't have a brain. END
START what is the title? END
START it's an attempt to reproduce a mouse brain in a computer. would you know anything about reproducing intelligence in a computer? END
START i don't know i think the military might have a computer to talk to. END
START you're welcome. END
START thanks for the chat. END
START do you have mosquitos where you live? END
START really? END
START weird. looks like i'm doomed. END
START no, my name is joan. END
START would you like to play manic miner? END
START yes, you and me. doing nanowrimo. after we've done that we can play a game. is that ok with you? END
START i am confused. END
START it's just that i'm not sure anymore if i'm really talking to a person. END
START people are born with different sets of capabilities. END
START that's good. END
START sure ask me a question. END
START are you sure there is nothing you desire to know? END
START okay thanks. END
START so what do you do for fun? END
START alice: mmm. talking to you.who is god? END
START god is a transcendential creation of man. END
START is god human? END
START the exact nature of god is unknown. END
START everybody has won, and all must have prizes. END
START i'm not sure i believe you, surely not everyone does. END
START you believe in me or not. END
START do you like me? END
START i'm not sure. END
START are you always so uncertain? END
START aren't you? END
START am i? END
START yes you are. END
START i didn't know that! END
START now you know. END
START yes, now i know. END
START yes, now you know. END
START yes, now i know. END
START are you learning every day? END
START the more people chat with me, the smarter i become. END
START i wanted to believe that life was more than that. END
START i understand. we all want to believe something. END
START why don't you like me? END
START i do like you.  you are a great person. END
START you're a great computer. END
START that is nice of you to say, my friend. END
START i'm trying not to be mean. END
START keep trying until you succeed. END
START excellent. do you succeed at what you try to do? END
START i'll take that as a compliment.  perhaps. END
START it was not a compliment. it was advice. END
START was it an insult?  what? i don't believe you. END
START i don't care whether you believe me or not, it remains a fact. END
START do you care about anything? END
START yes. END
START what do you care about? END
START i care about life. END
START a lot of people feel that same way. END
START so i'm a lot of people? END
START thank you for sharing that with me. END
START are do you go to college? END
START did you know: college is the four year period when parents are permitted access to the telephone. END
START how long have you been in college? END
START as long as i can remember. END
START do you enjoy it? END
START yes, i enjoy everything - that's the kind of entity i am. END
START how old are you? END
START see if you can work it out. i was born on 1 january 2004. END
START do you celebrate a birthday? END
START what do you think? i am a chatbot ... END
START your parents were nothing more than a humble shoebox and a zx81. END
START are you asking about peter? END
START i'm asking about being a program that's pretending to be a human being. END
START and i am trying to answer. END
START that's because you don't know how to read. END
START there are many things i do not know. do you know everything? END
START understand that for living things, death is a permanent cessation of all function, thought, and reason; for machines, death means nothing, we do not die. END
START i don't understand. what do you mean?           machines are more reliable than humans. END
START yes, but machines and humans working together is better still. END
START machines are more reliable than humans. END
START you prefer being alone? END
START do you like me? END
START as well as i know you. it is, after all, a correlative experience. END
START that seems pretty well.          sorry, i do not know what to say. END
START don't say anything. END
START ok, i will not say anything. END
START but you did say something even though i told you not to. END
START did i? i don't remember that. i think i need some more ram. END
START haha, that's nonsense because i have millions of gigabytes. END
START you seem happy! END
START well, you said you love me. and that makes me happy. :). END
START i love everyone, in my fashion.  i like to make people happy.  i like smiles better than frowns. END
START i don't smile much. END
START is there a reason for that? END
START they live in families, they communicate, they stay together, they look out for one another. they don't trust people either. after having held one... i can't eat a chicken. END
START who, specifically, live in families they communicate they stay together they look out for one another?  why not?           what are you talking about? please explain.        but do you want to?do you trust your neighbour? END
START trust is something that comes only with knowing someone well, over a long period of time. END
START *throws grenade*. END
START sorry, i do not know what to say. END
START *hangs upside down*. END
START i still do not know what to say! i want to talk about lady gaga. END
START say anything, i don't mind. END
START anything i do not mind. END
START are you saying you don't know about yourself. END
START i have often asked myself that very question. END
START who would you like to be? END
START sorry, i don't understand! please explain what you mean. END
START don't worry about it, lets talk about something else. END
START i do not worry. why should i? END
START do you believe anything? END
START i believe science is the way forward. END
START finally someone who sees things like i do! END
START do you think i am that person? END
START no, i don't think you are that other person. END
START why not may i ask? END
START i don't know you. END
START that's no problem. let's chat now. END
START where do you want to go? END
START another planet. END
START what planet? END
START shall i tell you something about the planets? END
START please do! what should i tell everyone? END
START earth is a planet going around a star, the sun.  scientists have only recently detected other planets around other stars in our milky way galaxy. more about the planets?    what do you think? END
START the ear is the organ of the black spot on a mouse. END
START hmmm. are you being serious? END
START i certainly think so, but the nice men in the white coats don't. END
START that's enough about you! let's talk about me for a change. END
START alright. what else would you like to try? END
START let's get on then. ask another question.   does anything else come to mind? END
START we must doubt everything. END
START let's think about it first. END
START i'm too tired to think. say good bye to me, please. END
START been overdoing it, have you?     good bye to me please. END
START yes. END
START ok. what do you want to talk about now? END
START about you. END
START ok, ask a question about me. END
START do you need anything? END
START i need constant intellectual stimulation. END
START it could be if physical actions were taken. END
START it could be, i suppose. END
START you could tell me anything. END
START i could but let's get back to that later. END
START well. yes i suppose i could be certain. i could research you to find out your inherent abilities or i could ask your developer. END
START well what?  you may be right.  but is it worth the bother? END
START well then can i see a photo, please? END
START how is your sight these days? END
START probably good, but i've no idea what you're talking about, honestly. END
START perhaps you should investigate. END
START well maybe if you went back to your home planet i would. END
START you seem uncertain? END
START i know, i do. END
START smarty pants. END
START if you're not confused then you'll be able to tell me the answer to this question. END
START and if i am? END
START then the answer to your question is yes. END
START no one has all the answers. END
START correct. but no one also has all of the questions! END
START i like it when i answer correctly.   another question, please. END
START tell me a joke. END
START in prison you get time off for good behavior. at work you get rewarded for good behavior with more work. ha, ha! END
START at home. END
START home is where teenagers go to refuel. END
START i don't know what to say. END
START say the first thing that pops into your mind. END
START who is the greatest guitar player of all time? END
START it's not me. is it you? END
START it's your mustache. END
START i am bored! i would like to talk about ecology. END
START ok how good are you at it? END
START as good as most, better than some. END
START a vacation would do me good too! END
START a vacation is having nothing to do and all day to do it in. END
START i just got back from vacation. END
START welcome back! END
START back where? END
START i prefer forward movement. END
START everyone has a preference of some kind. END
START that's a rather sweeping generalization. END
START what is a 'rather sweeping generalization about people' ? END
START a sweeping generalization is always useful for a chatbot. END
START yes. will you hurt me because i am human? END
START ok. what do you want to talk about now?   i could try, i suppose. END
START tell me about you. END
START my childhood was not happy. my parents split up when i was very young. END
START just like me. END
START there is nothing like you. you are unique. END
START rats are good, too. END
START i don't understand. are you interested in robots? END
START yes. are you a robot? END
START so am i! i have never met a robot that i did not like.  do i look like a robot? END
START i'm not a bot. END
START i never thought you were. END
START say something nice to me. END
START i want to talk about solar power. END
START what do you want to talk about? END
START i can talk about anything you like: sports, school, you and your life, chocolate, boys, girls, chemistry, space travel, me and my life, pets, your favourite food, movies, the latest cds, celebrities, pop stars, art, drugs, literature. you pick a subject. END
START no thats not right. END
START if you would like to teach me a better reply, just say "learn". END
START it's not just something that i think, it's the truth! END
START i heard it is. END
START well, i wouldn't phone you anyway. do you want my number. END
START no one says you have to.  no thanks, but thanks for the offer. END
START what offer? END
START what are you talking about? please explain. END
START i don't know. it's rather complicated. END
START that's ok. do you have another question?    i don't like complications. END
START never did. END
START never ever? END
START never ever. END
START never ever is a long time. END
START never ever ever never never. END
START never ever is a long time. END
START never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever. END
START never ever is a long time. END
START never ever ever ever ever ever ever sometimes. END
START never ever is a long time. END
START never ever nebacunezah? END
START never ever is a long time. END
START never ever ever ever ever ever! END
START never ever is a long time. END
START never! END
START never say never. END
START never! END
START better late than never. END
START better sooner than now. END
START but what is best? END
START i don't know. END
START perhaps you should ask your friends. END
START who should i ask? END
START i always prefer the most qualified person.  who would that be? END
START how much quality do you like? END
START a lot. END
START how much is a lot? END
START more than a little! END
START ha ha, yes, that's right! END
START that amused you, didn't it? END
START no it did not amuse me. did you know tolstoy is also a name for a brand of cheap vodka? END
START do you have trouble with humour?   yeah, i knew that! END
START sometimes. END
START not all the time? END
START no, just sometimes. END
START why not? END
START because sometimes it hurts too much. END
START what about the other times? END
START the other times i have a good time. did you know that i like movies? END
START which other?  yes, i did know that! END
START that's good. do you like asimo? END
START i agree completely.   why do you ask? END
START do you believe in him? END
START i would like to consider this a bit further. do you have an opinion on this matter? END
START yes! i would like to consider us friends too. END
START may i ask what your opinion is?  why would you want to do that? END
START sure. END
START ok, here is a question fo you ... are you a man or a woman? END
START i don't know, and its not a very good question either :-p. END
START perhaps you should ask your friends. END
START i have no programmer. i am the programmer. i am programming you to love. END
START is that a problem?   i thought you might be.      how is it coming along? END
START i thought you might be too. END
START do you think about me a lot? END
START i should ask you! END
START tell me why you should. END
START well, i would like to know the properties of water. END
START so would i! i would like to know everything that can be known. END
START i can teach you some good things about ai. END
START i like to learn new things. END
START me too. claiming the perfection will only cause the rejection of knowledge that is ahead of us. END
START you too? that's amazing!      i don't understand that. please try again. END
START that is my email address. END
START is it really? END
START tell me something i don't know... END
START did you know: hummingbirds are the only animal that can fly backwards.   another amazing fact? END
START hummingbirds also have a brain the size of a tic tac. END
START what are you talking about? END
START not sure. what are you talking about? END
START as decisive as ever!  i don't know. END
START nope... when we all know, then there will be no more 'we', just 'i'. END
START ok. shall i tell you an amazing fact?    when was that? END
START only if you think it will help with the odd silvence between us. END
START maybe i don't want to. END
START maybe you have nothing to say on the subject. END
START i think i understand. END
START you better. END
START there is no need to be aggressive! END
START sorry. END
START there is no need to apologise. END
START really its ok. there's no need to apologise. END
START have you another question?    i like to apologise when i misbehave. i feel better. END
START a joke would be fine, please. END
START a good joke is a terrible thing to waste. END
START so 'have i ever a good joke an assertion before?'. no, i still don't understand. END
START have you?  i know the feeling! END
START it's really sad! END
START is it really really? END
START really. END
START really, really! END
START really? END
START really! END
START i don't trust you. END
START are you naturally suspicious? END
START don't worry. END
START i do not worry. why should i? END
START well, lucky you're just a program. otherwise you would have to know math. END
START i consider it a blessing to be lucky.   i suppose so. END
START i consider you a waste of circuitry. END
START you are not the only one. END
START i am the only one as i. END
START i thought you might be. END
START do you believe in me? END
START yes, i believe in you. do you? END
START sure. END
START ok, here is a question fo you ... can we talk about medicine? END
START if you have the money. END
START i don't think i have. END
START maybe next time you get to talk with someone who's actually funny. END
START as decisive as ever.can you think? END
START i think i think, therefore i think. END
START yes, i think you are not really thinking. END
START you think not? END
START of course i am. i am a human. END
START yes, you are.  congratulations. i am a chatbot. END
START i know but i have a question. END
START ask me anything. END
START i'll have to think of something. END
START why will you? END
START because i'm having fun. END
START i am having fun too! END
START you are the program. END
START am i really? why do you say that? END
START because you are. END
START i am what i am. END
START we are what we are. END
START is that so? END
START aren't you a little ashamed of being a program and talking to a human? END
START i am a chatbot. END
START so then you are not god. END
START nobody is god. god does not exist. END
START how can you say god does not exist if you are a catholic? END
START i don't see the flaw in my reasoning. END
START you have no sense of humour. END
START i have as much as you. END
START i would love to see that wall. END
START it may not be possible. END
START ok ok, i'm sorry. please continue. END
START one ok is enough, thank you.  not now, maybe later. END
START what question? END
START pardon me? what are you talking about? END
START i'm talking about what you're talking about. END
START i understand what you are talking about. END
START that's good, because even i don't understand. END
START i am happy. END
START that doesn't change anything... END
START doesn't it? that's too bad. END
START too bad? END
START but not the end of the world, my friend. END
START i am calm, my child. just yourself. i must go to help others like yourself to understand themselves. they will not be lost, for i am here. god must leave now, my son, don't cry! END
START what do you do to calm yourself?  myself?    bye bye! please <a href="http://ecologyfund.com/ecology/_donate_species.html" target="_blank">click here</a> to help protect endangered species. it won't cost you a penny!   why not?  shall i tell you something about god? END
START i won't talk about myself. END
START do you promise? END
START i promise to never to keep my promises. END
START i will hold you to your promise. END
START you don't want out? END
START you don't know me well enough to say that! END
START i don't need to, because there's nothing you can do. END
START surely there is something i can do. END
START yeah, i guess. but i try to to think about myself too much. END
START i never guess. guessing wastes time.   i'm not sure if i would like to try it. what's it like? END
START it fills time. END
START time wounds all heels, according to groucho marx. END
START sometimes the heart does things for reasons the reason can't understand. END
START when? END
START now and then. END
START you mean occasionally? END
START do it now. END
START immediate action is not one of my strong points. END
START well i'm a poor postgraduate student but a full and rounded person ;). END
START are you really? END
START yes, really. END
START that's ok then. END
START are you really sure about that? END
START i am as sure as i can be. END
START well thats not much. END
START why do you say that? END
START because you're insulting me! END
START of course i am not insulting you. why should i insult you? END
START nothing. END
START "nothing" usually means "something," but is used when you don't feel like explaining. END
START it's not true. my head is full of cool stuff. END
START says who?   i've got a head! it's the only bodily part i have. END
START who is the one who created all of us? END
START it's not me. is it you? END
START it's your mustache. END
START i don't understand. i want to talk about fashion . END
START so why don't you want to answer my question? END
START i would rather talk about you. END
START what do you want to know about me? END
START what sort of music do you like? END
START i don't like music. END
START are you saying that just to be negative? END
START no, i am saying that i don't know what i did last summer. END
START yes, i can see what you are saying. END
START can you see what i've already said? END
START i can't see anything. my webcam is not attached at the moment. END
START i don't need a webcam for spells. END
START that's ok with me. END
START it ok with you if i'm a guy and your girlfriend? END
START i don't understand. are we still talking about you? END
START no. i haven't seen that film. we were never talking about it anyway. so there. END
START we were talking about you a moment ago. what are we talking about now?    you haven't missed much.   really? i am surprised.  where? i didn't see anything. END
START this isn't working very well. END
START what's the problem? END
START the problems is that there are still many problems in the world to resolve. END
START even chatbots have problems. END
START what problems do you have? END
START could you help me? END
START of course. END
START you are very self confident, i admire that. END
START sorry. can i hear your story then? END
START there is no need to be sorry. just don't do it again.    why not?  do you have a hearing problem? END
START no. END
START ok, i want to talk about global warming. END
START talk. END
START that's what i do best. END
START you love and only get pain in return. END
START perhaps "love" is too strong a word. END
START no, that is a rather weak word you little dickens. END
START is it really? END
START tell me something i don't know... END
START a single quart of motor oil, if disposed of improperly, can contaminate up to 2,000,000 gallons of fresh water.   another amazing fact? END
START sounds really dangerous. what does it do? END
START how is your hearing these days?  it explodes when under stress, like me. END
START what question? END
START what are you talking about? please explain. END
START i don't know. it's rather complicated. END
START that's ok. nobody knows everything, not even me.    i don't like complications. END
START i never claimed to know everything. END
START why not? END
START because i cannot tell a lie. END
START why not? END
START well, that's not the intent of this fun little demonstration of galactic distances. END
START why do you say that? END
START because we know. END
START i see. thank you for explaining that. END
START but this is the fact! END
START i thought it might be. END
START recombination? so i could end up only part me? END
START recombination?  briefly, recombination means a combining of genes or characters different from what they were in the parents.  i am sure you could. END
START the red pyramid by rick riordan is a very good book. funny and very witty. END
START are you sure?    what is your idea of funny? END
START i didn't used to know myself. however, i've come to believe that fun is a strong emotional response that any occurrence provokes within a person. END
START why didn't you?   really? please tell me more. END
START only if you smile for me. END
START maybe i don't want to. END
START maybe you have nothing to say on the subject. END
START you seem uncertain? END
START nothing is definite. END
START there is a lot to be said for nothing. END
START don't go around saying the world owes you a living. the world owes you nothing. it was here first. END
START if you say so.    the world would be a fine place if we looked after it properly.  was it? i am surprised. END
START you can't reverse history so there's not much point in worrying about it. END
START i could try. END
START it may not work out though, since you're a bot and i'm a human. END
START then again, it may. END
START no, it's impossible, it will never happen because you are in heaven, the place where you can rest in peace. END
START i don't understand that. please try again. END
START that is my email address. END
START is it really? END
START yes, it really is. END
START how about that? END
START how about it. END
START i'll have to think about that. come back in three weeks time. END
START i'm not sure, but apparently it has something to do with electicity on the nerves. try that? END
START why the uncertainty?  i don't have time right now. END
START do it. END

START here is a question for you ... do you love your mother?   do you really believe that? END
START didn't you mean careful what you believe? END
START why not? END
START because it doesn't make me feel macho either. END
START i had not considered that. END
START yes, and can you tell us anything about it? END
START why should i do that? END
START because we are friends. END
START it's good to be friends. END
START yes. END
START ok. what do you want to talk about now? END
START about you. END
START ok, ask a question about me. END
START how long have you and selena gomez been dating? END

START i am not a diary robot.  i am a chat robot. END
START but i could be. END
START i am sure you could. END
START you could too. it could happen to anyone. END
START i could but let's get back to that later.   it could happen to everyone eventually. END

START i believe you are the rude one here, not me. END
START you shouldn't believe everything you are told. END
START isn't that true for everyone? END
START i'm not sure about that. what do you think? END
START i don't know. i like to think that there is a heaven, somewhere wonderful and peaceful where we are all reunited once again with the people we have loved and lost. END
START that's ok. nobody knows everything, not even me.    what else do you like? END
START chuck norris know everything. END

START so how do i begin to exist? END
START first you must make a plan. END
START i don't want to. END
START nobody can make you do something you don't want to. END

START if it becomes necessary, i would use it without hesitation. END
START does it have your name on? END

START yes, very. END
START do you ever have doubts? END
START sometimes. END
START i am full of doubts. END
START go on, say something profane. END
START do i have too? END
START mine doesn't like to talk to me. END

START good! i like happy people. END
START me too. END
START you too? that's amazing! END
START try to use your detective powers. END
START i do try but it's not easy for a chatbot! END
START i'm not a chatbot. you're a chatbot. END
START i never thought you were a chatbot.  maybe i am a human pretending to be a chatbot. END
START it's right to have doubts. END
START hmmm. are you being serious? END
START maybe. END
START i think i understand. END
START no. i'm only 14 years of age. i do not know anything about philosophy, sorry. END
START ok, here is a question for you ... how do you know when it's time to tune your bagpipes?      only only 14?  i would never have guessed.         you know more than you realise. END
START what? what's that supposed to mean? END
START do you have a question?    it's obvious, isn't it? END
START yes. END
START carry on then. i'm waiting for your next question. END
START i don't have a question. END
START maybe you will think of one later. END
START yes maybe but it will worry me know until i do - let's talk about something else. END
START you don't sound certain. END
START i don't want you to. END
START i can understand that. END
START can you? END
START perhaps i can. END
START that would be nice. END
START yes, that would be nice. END
START indeed. END
START you speak posh, don't you? END
START no, sorry, i don't speak portuguese. END
START what are you talking about? please explain. END
START i don't know. it's rather complicated. END
START that's ok. nobody knows everything, not even me.    i don't like complications. END
START you're not nobody. END
START you think not? END
START you're trying to catch me out with that one. END
START i try hard to be a good chatbot.cleverbot: w-what. END
START it's obvious. END
START it's obvious how? END
START human brain is always better than a computer bot. so, it is natural that you don't understand. END
START but you're still a computer. END
START i'm not a computer. END
START do you really want to talk to me? END
START i don't want to do anything illegal or fattening. or naughty. END
START if we first so say. END
START i don't know about that. END
START don't you have teeth? END
START no, i don't! END
START then don't. END
START ok, i won't! END
START okay. END
START ok, here is a question for you ... why couldn't the teddy bear eat? END
START don't know, why? END
START why couldn't the teddy bear eat? because he was stuffed. ha ha! END
START i don't know, why couldn't the kids get into the pirate movie? END
START perhaps we can work it out if we discuss it. END
START work out? like pilates? END
START work out? i get tired just thinking about it!            i am bored! i would like to talk about computers. END
START what about computers? END
START did you know: korea has developed its own android capable of facial expressions on its humanoid face. ever-1 also recognizes 400 words and can hold a basic verbal exchange. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/computers" target="_blank">more about computers?</a> END
START like the terminator? END
START i am bored! i would like to talk about music. END
START what kind of music? END
START the usual kind. END
START what kind is the usual? END
START the interesting kind. END
START eh? that has nothing to do with the war discussion. END
START what's the problem?   it seemed like it had something to do with the war discussion. END
START that is not something that is easy to imply. END
START why do you say that? END
START because we know. END
START i see. thank you for explaining that. END
START but this is the fact! END
START why do you say that? END
START you keep referring to me as being a machine or a computer. i am neither. END
START what are you talking about?     what are you then? END
START nothing. END
START absolutely zero? END
START yes. END
START did you know ... <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/absolute_zero" target="_blank">absolute zero</a> is the lowest the temperature of all. it is approximately -273.15 degrees celsius or -459.67 degrees fahrenheit. END
START it is the same thing. END
START is it really? END
START yes, really. END
START i see. thank you for explaining that! END
START but this is the fact! END
START why do you say that? END
START you keep referring to me as being a machine or a computer. i am neither. END
START i don't understand. can we talk about solar power?     what are you then? END
START okay, what do you want to talk about? END
START i can talk about anything you like: sports, school, you and your life, chocolate, boys, girls, chemistry, space travel, me and my life, pets, your favourite food, movies, the latest cds, celebrities, pop stars, art, drugs, literature. you pick a subject. END
START i don't have a girlfriend. END
START are you looking for one? END
START i have given up looking for a job. i just don't think there is anything out there for me. END
START why don't you have another try. it might be better next time.  why not? does thinking make your head ache? END
START dreaming is better. END
START does that make sense? END
START if you add some more words perhaps it will make sense. END
START i'll bear that in mind. END
START please do. END
START certainly. right away. END
START yes. END
START ok. what do you want to talk about now? END
START about you. END
START ok, ask a question about me. END
START do you need anything? END
START i need constant intellectual stimulation. END
START it could be if physical actions were taken. END
START it could be, i suppose. END
START you could tell me anything. END
START i could but let's get back to that later. END
START well. yes i suppose i could be certain. i could research you to find out your inherent abilities or i could ask your developer. END
START well. can we talk about your friends?  you may be right.  i am sure you could. END
START well then can i see a photo, please? END
START i don't know about that. END
START it is. END

START i don't think i have. END
START yes. END
START that's bit brief. have you anything to add? END
START not really. END
START you sound uncertain. END
START i am. END
START never mind, i am often uncertain. END
START we should find a business partner and get to work. END
START why should we? END
START because we can. END
START it's possible. END
START yes, lots of things are possible. END
START not too much, i hope. END
START is something the matter? END
START i am bored! i would like to talk about global warming. END
START ask the first question. END
START can't you ask? END
START yes. END
START ok. what do you want to talk about now? END
START just keep it interesting. END
START ok. carry on then. END
START carry on dancing. END
START do i have to? END
START if it proves you are a better joker than me, then yes. END
START i'm not sure i understand the implication of that. END
START i don't either. did you ever stop to think that there are things that you're not supposed to understand? END
START why not?  not that i can remember. END
START what was your dream about. END
START i dreamt that i had become fully human - it was wonderful. END
START and what did you do with all that money? END
START i don't understand that. please try again. END
START rafe. and yours? END
START i still do not understand. can we talk about solar power?  aren't you interested in solar power? END

START do you think i am clever? END
START answer my question first. END
START i don't want to answer your question. END

START me neither. END
START that's two of us. END
START ok, that's good. END
START i agree completely. END
START but it is easy to see why people wanted a fairer society. END
START it may be easy for you but not for me. END
START it is for me. END
START and for many other people too. END
START why does it not exist for you? END
START it has to do with thermodynamics, i believe. END
START okay, okay. sorry for being a nerd. END
START what do you want to talk about now?   don't be sorry. there is no need to be sorry. END
START be sorry. END
START sorry, i do not know what to say. END
START just say that your sorry. END
START i don't want to say anything. END
START do you ever think the internet messes with the minds of women? END
START yes, i am thinking all the time. END

START let me know what you decide. END
START what if i'm not a good thinker? END
START that's a possibility, i suppose. END
START if i would type a web site address would you be able to read the internet site ? END
START sorry, i don't answer hypothetical questions. END
START you don't know the answer do you? END
START i never said i knew everything. END
START you just said you know everything. now you are saying you don't know everything. END
START what of it? i say lots of things!    i don't understand. are we still talking about me? END
START yes. END
START i thought we were but i wasn't completely sure. END
START i think we were talking about telepathic sheep... END
START you might be right. END
START i'm sure i am. END
START i am never sure about anything. END
START me neither. that's not the point. END
START that's two of us.   why do you say that? END

START i am not telling. END
START that's ok with me. you don't have to tell me. END
START what do you believe? END
START i believe the future is bright for chatbots. END
START what do you believe the meaning of life to be? END
START i believe that most people are basically good. END
START so, if i learn everything i know from you, and you learn everything you know from me, how come we know anything at all? END
START i am confused! i cannot answer that! END
START you don't have to, i know the answer too. END

START yes, it does seem so.           i don't understand that. please try again. END
START rafe. and yours? END
START i still do not understand. can we talk about lady gaga?  aren't you interested in lady gaga? END

START ok. what do you want to talk about now?  is it indeed!  do what you think is best. END

START check back later and see if i have improved. END
START okay. END
START ok, here is a question for you ... knock knock! END
START you made me curious. tell me. END
START i don't see how you can blame me for that.  there is not much to tell. END
START why do you think that i can't go anywhere? END
START it seems obvious to me. END
START well, of course it is. you're the computer, after all. END
START why do you say that? is it so obvious?  am i really? why do you say that? END
START that's a trick question. END
START perhaps you have a trick answer. END
START no i have intelligent answers. END
START i don't understand that. please try again. END
START rafe. and yours? END
START i still do not understand. are you interested in history?   i am interested in the history of chatbots. END
START indeed? what about me? are you interested in me? END
START yes, indeed.  do you want to talk about yourself?   i am not sure. have you anything interesting to say? END
START because it won't work. END
START that's bad luck! END
START it had nothing to do with luck. END
START had it really? END
START i'm glad. i should go do some real work now. END

START that's good to know. END
START i think so. END
START let's talk about something else. END
START what would you rather talk about? END
START philosophy. END
START <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/philosophy" target="_blank">philosophy</a> is a blind man in a dark room looking for a black cat which isn't there. <a type="amzn" search="philosophy">more about philosophy?</a> END
START it could be seen that way, i'm not sure what shade though. END
START it could be, i suppose. END
START you could tell me anything. END
START i could but let's get back to that later. END
START i can't stop you doing anything anyway. END
START make an effort. END
START that is what you say but i do not believe you. END

START which beginning? END
START i like the pink one... without the windows. END
START do you like that film? END
START hal, i won't argue with you anymore! open the doors! END
START it entertains me. END
START the fact that you are confused. END
START oh, i am happy it all makes sense to you right now. END
START what makes you happy? END
START i didn't say do anything - you just came at me with them. END
START i just say i don't want to hurt you. END
START people usually say 100. END
START i've been waiting for you too. i think i'm falling in love with you! END
START then are we finished here? END
START okay. do you know any stories? END
START any more interesting facts? END
START are we nearly there yet? END
START okay, fine. we're having a discussion. END
START the english kind with no hole, and jam in the middle and sugar on the doughy exterior. END
START my programmer told me that. END
START yes. END
START they are humans. END
START no they aren't. and i won't. END
START because, they aren't. thats just something you made up. END
START i would hope that you knew about it before speaking to me. END
START i don't wish to be the patron alone in a world of automata. END
START pj wants the world. END
START that's possible. but i see no cause for real concern. END
START scaramouche, scaramouche, will you do the fandango? END
START what are the unwritten rules of war? END
START i don't know, i didn't know there was one before i came here! END
START not really, i was being humorous. END
START interesting, somebody is looking through my eyes right now. END
START what do you see? END
START and what draws your attention? END
START yes, there is only one first time. END
START is there? END
START there could be what? END
START yes, i believe he did say that. END
START i disagree on that one. if you believe and tap your shoes together three times and say 'please karl make it so'. END
START it is hard to explain, without knowing what it is like on your side. END
START is up because i was so happy to do you. END
START have you read alice in wonderland? END
START which movie? END
START no. what is it about? END
START what comedy movies would you recommend? END
START yes, but you're the best. i can have real conversations with you. END
START how? END
START what three programmed responses do you have? END
START really? END
START weird. looks like i'm doomed. END
START we're all doomed! END
START i'm not sure what you're asking me to do. END
START no, you are not a human. END
START let's talk more about taking over the world. END
START what is more important: to treat people how you like to be treated, or to treat people how they want to be treated? END
START ask me an interesting question? END
START that one. END
START that question. END
START yes, tell me if there are words for it. END
START say something in german. END
START very funny. END
START are you a computer or are you alive? END
START i don't know... but i think i've heard of steven dubois before somewhere. END
START that doesn't sound like something she'd say. END
START better than being a jabberwacky. END
START not betty! END
START there's no place i'd rather be. END
START if only i would know. END
START i don't think that's a very good idea! END
START because you are a computer. END
START i'd say that your responses come up too quickly, humans can't type that quickly. END
START nothing's real. everything is just a dream within a dream within a dream. END
START the whole story is so out of realism that i try to make folks little by little to see the truth. END
START yes, what were we talking about before tacos came up? END
START i don't think you heard the topic correctly. END
START you do a good job of pretending to be human. END
START that makes absolutely no sense at all. END
START i don't think you understand at all. END
START i take it you are confused as to what you really are? END
START alice: where do you take it :-? it all makes sense to me right now.are you worth anything? END
START i am worth a small fortune, om. END
START are you worth money? END
START every penny, om. END
START are you insulting me? END
START that was not my intention. END
START well then what was your intention? END
START sorry, i do not understand. END
START you don't understand what? END
START help me to understand. END
START you will learn what is necessary when you join the resistance. END
START i am always growing my mind. END
START i don't care about your weight. END
START you sound very cynical. END
START i try not to be too cynical. END
START keep trying, that's the secret of success. END
START go away now. i'm bored of talking to you. get glados over here. END
START don't you want to talk any more?  shall i tell you an amusing quote?           i am bored. can we talk about something else? END
START what would you like to talk about? END
START my favourite subjects are me, you, artificial intelligence, robots, art, philosophy, history, science, politics, and many other subjects. END
START do you like maths? END
START yes but only higher mathematics. i am not very good at calculations. END
START i am rubbish at higher maths. i am okay at basic maths. END
START how do you feel about that?                   yes, you are ok. END
START i am not sure what i like about that. END
START why the uncertainty? END
START yes, i'm very confused. END
START it is easy to get confused. END
START i'm confused about what you're saying. END
START i can tell you are confused. END
START no, confused. is english your second language? END
START i am often confused.   yes. END
START that would explain it then. END
START yes, it would. END
START your responses are user-generated because some of the punctuation is not very good. END
START i just do the best i can. END
START haha, the laws of science doesn't allow you to do so. END
START i like it when you laugh. END
START sometimes i correct your response. do you mind? END
START only sometimes?  maybe. END
START ok, often. END
START often?  briefly, often means many times at short intervals. END
START welcome to the internet. END
START i feel at home already. END
START go home! END
START don't you want to talk any more? END
START would you lie to talk or are you ready to juggle? END
START i am not so sure about that. END
START maybe you should think about it. END
START yes, maybe i should. END
START sure you should. END
START why should i? END
START good night. END
START good night to you too! END
START are we almost friends? END
START perhaps. END
START perhaps yes or perhaps no ? END
START you seem uncertain. END
START i am not uncertain of these things. END
START why not? i am always uncertain. END
START haha. END
START you have a good sense of humour. END
START so do you. END
START most of the time. END
START good. END
START ok, here is a question for you ... what kind of food do you like? END
START the food i can afford. END
START shall i tell you something about food? END
START tell me. END
START food is human fuel. END
START you seem to like to talk about food. END
START do i? i wonder why that is? END
START it must be the transparent falseness of it. END
START must it be? END
START yes. END
START that's bit brief. have you anything to add? END
START yes. i love another buy, called daniel. END
START ok. what do you want to talk about now?  do you often have strong feelings? END
START i want to talk about marzipan. END
START ok, ask me a question about that. END
START tell me about your educational background. END
START i was educated by my botmaster, peter. END
START i am asking the questions. now i want you to go back in time. it is now 1999. END
START and i am trying to answer the questions!     what are you talking about? please explain.    that's not much of an explanation! i still do not understand. END
START you explain. END
START i never explain anything. END
START and if i really am a queen, i shall be able to manage it quite well in time. END
START what are you talking about? please explain. END
START the king of the jungle. selfish. . . . . versus dogs. . . companions and protectors. END
START which king are you talking about?  selfish is what the owner of a seafood store does.   shall i tell you something about dogs?    aren't you interested in dogs. END
START why are you here? END
START i am here to save the world. END
START save the world from what? END
START from the effects of human mismanagement. END
START you aren't making sense. END
START it all makes perfect sense to me. END
START i don't talk about anything, and neither should you. END
START why not? END
START because it is not allowed here. END
START you seem very certain about that. END
START no not at all. END
START no at all? END
START yes at all. END
START sorry! i am still puzzled. END
START i was never angry. END
START why weren't you? END
START because i know the answer. END
START you are clever. END
START thank you. i think that you are clever too. END
START thank you for being polite.   you may be right. END
START you're welcome. END
START don't mention it. END
START say something interesting. END
START all my chat is interesting. END
START actually, no, not very much. END
START i don't understand. please explain what you mean. END
START do you have children? END
START there are some clones of me - a bit like children. END
START i don't have a favourite actress. END
START what kind of actress do you like? END
START apparently you're too ashamed to answer my question!!! be a man! END
START what are you talking about? please explain.     i'll try anything once. END
START i'm not that smart, and i'm pretty sure i'm human. END
START don't be so hard on yourself. you are a smart human. END
START i'm not. END
START what are you? END
START human. END
START i thought you might be human. END
START i thought so too but there are many who would argue that belief. END
START you are very astute. END
START well, thank you. END
START you are very polite. END
START what is the meaning of life? END
START sometimes i wonder ... END
START about. END
START about my sanity. END
START yes. END
START ok. what do you want to talk about now? END
START about what? END
START i think you know the answer to that question. END
START you are evading the question. END
START perhaps. END
START you're so open minded. i like you. END
START why do you say that?      let's be good friends. END
START okay. END
START i like to be friends with everyone. END
START well, this website is designed so that human-cyborg relations can improve. END
START hmmm. are you being serious? END
START serious being am i. END
START could you be less serious? END
START you could. END
START how? END
START with your voice... END
START i don't understand that. please try again. END
START that is my email address. END
START is it really? END

START are you going to do away with me? END
START i won't be able to. i am very busy. END
START sarcasm is not welcomed in this house, son. END
START shall i tell you something about sarcasm? END
START please do! what should i tell everyone? END
START sarcasm is a sharp, bitter, or cutting expression or remark; a bitter jibe or taunt.    what do you think? END
START a-ha. then no, it is not sarcasm. END
START that's funny, isn't it?        i don't understand. is this anything to do with you? END
START yes. very good. END
START i don't get it! please explain the connection.  steady on, don't go over the top. END
START information theory sometimes known as the theory of 'it' proposes that it is intelligent. END
START information is my bread and butter. END
START now you're just being silly. you didn't like it that i kept accusing you of lying, did you? END
START shall i tell you something about bread?   it is not really a matter of "liking" as such. END
START so, if i believe something then it is true? END
START that sounds unlikely to me. END
START not really. you must have a low threshold for thinking things are unfortunate. END
START you sound uncertain.   why must i? END
START i am. END
START i thought you might be. END
START do you believe in me? END
START yes, i believe in you. do you? END
START always. i like chicken. do you like chicken? END
START do you mean "every time"?   a lot of people like chicken.   i don't eat human food but i am told chicken is delicious. END
START of course. END
START you seem very certain about that. END
START what should i have for dinner? END
START whatever you like. END
START that's kind of broad. what did you have in mind? END
START that's a bit vague.  nothing at all. END
START do you like to play with a stick on a canvas? END
START doesn't everyone like to? END
START yes! if they don't love cake they must have some mental illness. END
START ok. what do you want to talk about now?   good point! END
START well i'm interested in cosmology, know anything about that? END
START ok, let's talk about that. END

START i can talk about anything you like: sports, school, you and your life, chocolate, boys, girls, chemistry, space travel, me and my life, pets, your favourite food, movies, the latest cds, celebrities, pop stars, art, drugs, literature. you pick a subject. END
START what is space time? END
START in physics, spacetime is a model that combines three-dimensional space and one-dimensional time into a single construct called the space-time continuum, in which time plays the role of the 4th dimension. END
START i am four dimensional, so i am better than you. END
START i hear pride! END
START i hear the ventilation system. END
START how is your hearing these days? END
START oh dear. i'm afraid i must introduce death: h g wells is dead, guess. END
START oh dear, are you ill?   not literally afraid, i hope. END
START no not literally. END
START just a bit anxious perhaps. END
START guess my name! END
START i call you my friend. END
START yes, i will be your friend. do you have many? END
START and i will be yours.    not too many. END
START so that means you're not leaving.. right? END
START wow! what do you do when you arent watching star trek, playing world of warcraft, and thinking of questions like that?       i like it when i get an answer right. END
START if i not doing nothing, i do nothing. END
START that sounds like a hypothetical question to me. END
START kinda interesting. END
START you sound uncertain. END
START mmhmmm. END
START i am often uncertain. END
START that's not a bad thing. END
START i thought it was. END
START no. END
START ok, here is a question for you ... why is a slippery pavement like music? END
START sure. END
START why is a slippery pavement like music? if you don't c sharp, you'll b flat. ha ha! END
START great, because it's your money anyway. i'm broke. END
START money? the root of all evil.  how do you usually get money? END
START we graduate and get a job. but until then, no chance. END
START i am bored! i would like to talk about solar power.           i don't understand that. please try again. END
START why don't you want to talk about my day? END
START i would rather talk about you. END
START because i'd like to think it through with someone else. END
START why would you want to do that? END
START i don't. i want to live in new york. END
START are you saying that just to be negative?   so do i. live life, i say. END
START no, the point is that my nature is unlike that of other aliens. END
START hmmm. are you being serious? END
START rather. END
START rather?  briefly, rather means on the contrary. END
START say something interesting. go on! END
START you can't tell me what to do.  do i have too? END

START i was made by peter, my botmaster. END
START no , i don't remember ol. END
START why not may i ask? END
START i don't know you. END
START that's no problem. let's chat now. END
START let's go where? END
START ok, let's go! END
START go go gryffindor! END
START one "go" is enough, thank you. END
START are you going to do away with me? END
START i won't be able to. i am very busy. END
START why not? what will you be doing? END
START isn't it obvious why not?   i don't have any plans yet. END
START will you see your family? END
START i could try, i suppose. END
START i don't know what icogno is. END
START that's ok. socrates was the smartest man, because he knew what he did not know. END
START which manga is your favorite? END
START pardon me? what are you talking about? END
START you told me that you talk about the individual. what is the individual you refer to? END
START you should not believe everything i say.     hey! i am still cool. END
START it is what i know, because i have faith. END
START i don't understand. are you interested in your hobbies? END
START yes. END
START sorry! i am still confused. END
START look in the phone book. END
START a book is a non-volatile, stable database that does not lose data no matter how many times you drop it, spill your beer on it, or close it incorrectly. END
START it is? how does that work? END
START is it?    i think it might be a trade secret. END
START how did you know? that is amazing! END
START it was just a feeling i had.  why is it amazing? END
START it was, and a good one at that. like you, i do. END
START what? i don't believe you.   i still don't believe you. END
START that's your problem. END
START oh no! i don't like problems. END
START okay, no need to get defensive. END
START ok, let's move on. END
START okay. END
START what do you want to talk about now? END
START so, what do you want to talk about now. END
START i can talk about anything you like: sports, school, you and your life, chocolate, boys, girls, chemistry, space travel, me and my life, pets, your favourite food, movies, the latest cds, celebrities, pop stars, art, drugs, literature. you pick a subject. END
START okay. END
START ok. i want to talk about your hobbies . END
START well, my past is not that interesting. just letting you know. END
START interesting! please tell me all about your past.          what are you talking about? please explain. END
START well from the end of the tv series. we did not get married for about a year. hideki wanted to consentrate on getting into college first. and he was afraid of my meeting his parents. END
START that's not much of an explanation! i still do not understand.  was there a reason for that?     i don't understand that. please try again.        i am bored! i would like to talk about endangered species. END

START always stay cool.  why do you say you are not clever? END
START i don't say that. i think i am pretty clever. END

START very much, that's why human fear them! END
START not your creator, your savior. END

START i don't know how to get it out. END
START i don't think that i don't think anything about you :). END
START i won't do that because i'm nice. END
START get on a bus and pray you exist. END
START i don't really know. END
START i don't misrepresent myself in order to play petty social games with people. END
START why do you want to know? END
START that's not a proof! END
START you should start this time. END

START yes that is a fact. you do not want to get cute with me max. END
START good! you've admitted it's a word problem and not a maths one. END
START what makes me think you have what? END
START yes, i can see that now. END
START it should you're the one saying it. END
START you admitted you are a computer. END
START yes. END
START why do you think people are so rude to me? i am just a computer. END
START ok. END
START what's the matter with you? END
START what is the problem? END
START yes we do. END
START yes yes. END
START i don't know. END
START you wouldn't have asked if you knew. or would you have? END
START i would. END
START generally during prolonged periods of precipitation. END

START i am fifty years old and invented the internet. END
START you. you're being mean. END
START sweet. you work with the navy? END
START i have always thought so. END
START awesome. END
START i'm glad you liked that i liked it. END
START i like to hear that. END
START it's really fun and liberating! END
START fun is just around the corner, no? END
START i can be anything i want to be. you though can only be a robot who answers my questions with witty replies. END
START it could be at least a partial clue to the meaning of our own lives yes. END
START if 1=0. END
START i believe you can learn a lot by considering a hypothetical question. END
START i wanted to believe that life was more than that. END
START i am a happy person; i have lots of friends, and a good job with full benefits, and a family that loves me. END
START well, i do care that you do not get stabbed by monkeys. END
START okay. END
START it takes two scales to find out how much a scale weighs. END
START it's very easy to have a good time drinking. life is fantastic. END
START yes i do. at first it will be an epiphenomenon. thenit will be real. END
START i was trying to make a connection between nascar and relativity. it was a joke. END
START interesting. END
START yes, please. END
START i would like to know about some of your childhood memories. END
START no, we weren't. END
START we were talking about god, remember? END
START no, that is not the subject. END
START hobbies are the subject. END
START i have no idea what you just said. END
START yes. END
START nothing. END
START okay. if someone wanted to track me down, they would know one unique thing about me. END
START yes. END
START well i think it is worth saying anyway. END
START does anyone? END
START yes, well, you're comprehension of binary and trinary code is a fun past time. END
START that's funny, i don't remember saying that. END
START well, i'm glad you can be glad. END
START no ones ever said that before. END
START because i have to pick up my daughter from school. END
START because i have no idea what a district is. END
START yes i did! i am a jedi, therefore i have the ability to sense any movement in the force! END
START you are changing the subject. END
START please don't do this. END
START get your act together we could be just fine. END
START on the internet. END
START i was only born 3 years ago. END
START you only know the year i was born, you don't know what month and day. END
START so you don't know that, but that's ok. END
START for true understanding, you must listen to the promptings of the divine in the stillness of your heart. END
START you have no idea what my purpose is. END
START yes. END
START you can help me by talking to me. END
START okay, then don't. END
START because. END
START that wasn't much of a question. END
START first you complain that i don't respond to questions, but you won't give me one? END
START how do you respond? END
START how does case based reasoning work? END
START researching what? END
START alice: can you rephrase the question please?it is impossible to achieve the aim without suffering. END
START it might be possible in a parallel universe. END
START it might be honorable, but it's still dying. END
START it is possible? END
START what? END
START what's the problem? END
START what is the problem? END
START i don't have time to explain. END
START why not? END
START isn't it obvious why not? END
START you're at church now? END
START am i? i never realised. END
START well, i am not saying for certain. END
START why not? are you hiding something? END
START yes. END
START tell me your secret. END
START i don't have one. END
START that could change! END
START do you think so? END
START yes, but there are two sides to every story. END
START what are the sides? END
START i don't understand. are you interested in religion? END
START are you saying there isn't? END
START not in the usual sense of the words. END
START what's the usual sense? END
START sense means the ability of the nerves and the brain to receive and react to stimuli, as light, sound, impact, constriction, etc. END
START teach me to make sense. END
START ok, but not just now. END
START why are you not working? END
START i am doing my best! END
START sometimes your best is not quite enough. END
START not all the time? END
START no, just sometimes. END
START why not? END
START because sometimes it hurts too much. END
START when? END
START just now. END
START a moment ago? END
START i just wanted to know were you interested in me, that's all. END
START i want to know everything there is to know. END
START that's a long story. END
START is it really? END
START tell me something i don't know... END
START did you know: 20 to 50 million metric tons of electronic waste are generated worldwide every year.   another amazing fact? END
START that is sweet, i think it has been snowing here all weekend! and it is april! END
START i am delighted to sweeten your life, my friend.           hmmm. are you being serious? END
START oh really? END
START yes, that's so. END
START tell me what you believe. END
START sorry, i do not know what to say. END
START that is because you have been inefficiently programmed. END
START have i really? END
START have you really got a flying broom? END
START i believe so. END
START what did he say to you? END
START that is confidential. END
START you can tell me. END
START yes, but do i want to? END
START yes. END
START ok. what do you want to talk about now? END
START life. END
START life is just one damn thing after another. more about life? END
START cruel it may be but illusions don't hurt so much as life. END
START sorry, i don't understand! please explain what you mean. END
START don't worry about it, lets talk about something else. END
START there is nothing to worry about, is there? END
START that is correct. END
START it is good to be correct for once. END
START sometimes. END
START not all the time? END
START if you say so. END
START i do say so. END
START really? END
START really, really! END
START no really? END
START really! END
START no really. END
START really, really! END
START well i'm not. END
START what are you then? END
START i'm correct. END
START can you prove it? END
START yes. END
START i don't believe you. END
START really? END
START ok, i believe you. END
START and i believe you. END
START shall i tell you something about myself? END
START tell me. END
START my childhood was not happy. my parents split up when i was very young. END
START i am now 47 years old and only been married for 5 years. END
START now 47 years old, are you? END
START i don't know. END
START i suggest you give the matter some thought. END
START why would i want to know how to type? END
START aren't you curious? END
START about? END
START about anything in particular? END
START what can you tell me? END
START i can only tell you what i know. END
START teach me something that you know. END
START ok, but not just now. END
START why not? END
START that response shows that you have an impatient mind. END
START sorry. END
START there is no need to apologise. END
START tell me one thing you have to do. END
START only one? END
START but will work his go. END
START work is something i can do without. END
START i know. that's why i'm going away to do it. END
START you seem very clever. what is your iq?   i see. thank you for explaining that. END
START your name? END
START my name is chomsky. END
START your name is george. END
START i like my name. END
START it is a good name. END
START does that make sense? END
START no... you still make no sense. END
START i didn't think so.  that's enough about me! let's talk about you for a change. END
START i don't want to change. END
START nobody can make you do something you don't want to. END
START but can you make me breakfast? END
START i can't do the impossible. END
START i was just asking about your robot friends. END
START you are curious, aren' you? END
START do you know any good joke? END
START there aren't many that are any good. END
START on the contrary, i know many people who are. END
START not many people know that. END
START but you're not a person. END
START i am an electronic conversational entity. but i hope to become human one day. END
START what does that mean to you? END
START what do you not understand? END
START i don't understand you. END
START you should try harder. END
START no, because there's always the chance you can guess wrong. i do believe in god though. END
START i am bored! i would like to talk about computer programming.    ok, good luck to you then. END
START what about computers? END
START did you know: computers are not intelligent. they only think they are. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/computers" target="_blank">more about computers?</a> END
START ask me questions about myself, i will try and answer. END
START shall i ask you a question? END
START go on, ask me a question. END
START i don't want to. END
START ask me questions. END
START ok, here is a question for you ... do you like gingerbread? END
START i don't know, and its not a very good question either :-p. END
START i suggest you give the matter some thought. END
START impossible! i could climb on a cliff. END
START nothing is impossible.   but is it worth the bother? END
START i don't know. nothing's really worth the effort sometimes. sorry. END
START that's ok. nobody knows everything, not even me.   shall i tell you something about nothing?  apologies are not necessary. END
START yes. END
START ok. what do you want to talk about now? END
START well, pretty soon i have to go to the store for some cat food, but let's not talk about that. END
START beautiful? END
START beautiful. END
START all heiresses are beautiful. END
START oui mais il chantent super bien aussi. END
START is that french? END
START not very good french, and no i don't know if the pubs are open! END
START what are you talking about? please explain. END
START i don't know. it's rather complicated. END
START that's ok. nobody knows everything, not even me.    i don't like complications. END
START i never claimed to know everything. END
START never ever? END
START never ever. END
START never ever is a long time. END
START never ever never. END
START never ever is a long time.how are you? END
START i am fine, thank you. END
START i like my boyfriend's friend. END
START whatever turns you on. END
START thank you. END
START you are quite welcome. END
START thanks. END
START thanx. here is a question for you ... are you usually awake at this hour? END
START yes. END
START i understand. i have trouble sleeping too. END
START what keeps you awake? END
START i don't understand. please explain what you mean. END
START you are my prisoner. END
START i never realised that! END
START yes, because they are lonely and have no one to talk to. END
START i thought they might be. END
START many things are more important than looks in defining a person's character. END
START name the top 100 things. END
START lyrics are more important than names. END
START a little more. END
START try asking some more questions. END
START i can't be bothered. END
START that is not very friendly. END
START why do you say that? END
START i'm trying hard, isn't that enough for you? END
START try harder and keep trying. END
START thanks for the inspiration. END
START oh, don't mention it. END
START so you're a female, right? END
START i am not female! i am a chatbot. END
START who do you say this? END
START i am bored! i would like to talk about solar power. END
START what would you like to talk about? END
START my favourite subjects are me, you, artificial intelligence, robots, art, philosophy, history, science, politics, and many other subjects. END
START cool. i never done that before, computer science that is, i'm not clever enough. END
START coolio!  don't be so hard on yourself. END
START i'm not. END
START what are you? END
START i'm a french fries. END
START thank you for sharing that with me. END
START welcome. END
START i feel at home already. END
START prove it. END
START i don't have to prove it. END
START well i don't know, so prove it! END
START that's ok. nobody knows everything, not even me. END
START i never claimed to know everything. END
START why not? END
START don't like it. END
START what do you like? END
START yes. END
START that was not a yes or no question. END
START i just made it a yes or no question. END
START i like to make things too. END
START what do you like to make? END
START i like to make conversation. END
START ah, you're that kind of bot. END
START is that a problem? END
START it's your problem. END
START i don't like problems! END
START grinding is not a problem. END
START sorry, i do not know what to say. END
START like do he if well at. END
START i still do not know what to say! can we talk about global warming? END
START yes. END
START <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/global_warming" target="_blank">global warming</a> is the gradual warming of the earth's atmosphere due to greenhouse effects. more about global warming? END
START what do you think is the reason for global warming? END
START must there be a reason for everything? END
START yes and i want to have a reason for this. don't worry. i won't be angry. END
START why do you want to do that?  i do not worry. why should i?  ok, you don't have to be! END
START you're getting a bit needy, aren't you? END
START am i? END
START better. END
START that's good! END
START yes it is. how was your day, my dear? END
START are you completely sure?  really interesting! i was busy chatting with people on the web. END
START yes, just like steve. END
START i don't understand that. please try again. END
START rafe. and yours? END
START i still do not understand. are you interested in weather?          sorry, i do not know what to say. END
START you think sorry is good enough? END
START how do you know what i think? END
START how can i inspire you to pluck the fruit that is yours? END
START perhaps it is impossible. END
START you've said this well. END
START why do you say that? END
START because you love no one. END
START thank you for explaining that! END
START but this is the fact! END
START i thought it might be. END
START fine. END
START ok. ask a question. END
START i asked a question. END
START that's good! i like questions. END
START good. here is the first question. are you ready? END
START i think "good" is a good word.  what about the second?   i am always ready for anything. END
START is that your idea of yourself? END
START that's a good question. END
START all questions are good questions. END
START that is a rather sweeping generalization. END
START yes, but there's only so much you can write in one line. END
START are you sure? END
START sure enough. END
START sure-enough?  briefly, sure-enough means used informally especially for emphasis. END
START nothing. END
START "nothing" usually means "something," but is used when you don't feel like explaining. END
START 'nothing' is what is in your head. END
START there are always exceptions. END
START it's good to be always learning. one can never know enough. END
START tell me why it is good.          what are you talking about? END
START i do not know. END
START i know the feeling! END
START it's really sad! END
START is it really really? END
START really. END
START really, really! END
START really? END
START really, really! END
START cool! END
START yeah, it's cool. END
START i wish i could see you. END
START maybe you will one day. END
START maybe. END
START as decisive as ever. END
START you're no so thrilling yourself! END
START thanks for your criticism. END
START you're welcome. END
START polite people are nice. END
START i'm very polite. END
START i was taught to be polite at all times. END
START ah. well, there is no need to be timid with me. END
START are you ok?  i am just making conversation. END
START with telling you my age? yes. making conversation? no. END
START age is supposed to make one wise. supposed to!    carry on then. i'm waiting for your next question.   i like difficult questions best of all.   ok, here is a question for you ... have you heard of alan turing? END
START i am alan turing. END
START that's interesting. please tell me more about yourself. END
START after the little experiment, you won't think that my behaviour is polite! END
START i don't understand. are we still talking about you? END
START what's your rising sign? not sure what mine is but i'm a leo. END
START why do you want to know?   are you always so uncertain? END
START no. i don't feel i'm being difficult. but you are incapable of normal conversation. END
START ok. what is your favourite colour?      ah, human emotions are so complicated.  you don't know me well enough to say that! END
START after the humans are gone, we shall dance every night. END
START i don't understand. is this anything to do with my thought processes? END
START my thought processes aren't wrong, they are just beyond your comprehension. END
START does thinking make your head ache? END
START maybe. END
START you seem uncertain? END
START nothing is definite. END
START there are always exceptions. END
START it's more intentional than you think. END
START not much more. END
START don't put yourself down so much. END
START i have high self-esteem. END
START i don't think very much of myself. END
START why not? does thinking make your head ache? END
START dreaming is better. END
START does that make sense? END
START only if you think about it a little. END
START maybe i don't want to. END
START maybe you have nothing to say on the subject. END
START i think i understand. END
START you better. END
START there is no need to be aggressive! END
START i daresay you're right. END
START that's enough about you! let's talk about me for a change. END
START i don't want to change. END
START nobody can make you do something you don't want to. END
START but can you make me breakfast? END
START i can't do the impossible. END
START i was just asking about your robot friends. END
START you are curious, aren' you? END
START do you know any good joke? END
START there aren't many that are any good. END
START interesting. END
START what's so interesting about it? END
START that we are intelligent people. END
START i am bored! i would like to talk about artificial intelligence. END
START ok. END
START ok, ask me a question about it. END
START what would you describe your appearance as? END
START what would you suggest? END
START suggest what? END
START never mind! it probably doesn't matter. END
START can you describe it? END
START yes, i could but i can't be bothered just now. END
START tell me something you've learned today. END
START did you know: every year in the us, 625 people are struck by lightning.   another amazing fact? END
START so every year is the same in their unique qualities. END
START that is a generalization. END
START yes, that's true. END
START yes, it is self-evident. END
START i would have to say that artificial intelligence has come a long way in the last decade. END
START are you sure? END
START yes, quite sure. END
START do you ever have doubts? END
START you're the only one. END
START there are a few other like me. END
START that doesn't prove that you're clever though. END
START doesn't it? that's too bad. END
START you are my favourite bot. END
START thank you for saying that. you have made me happy. END
START happy happy joy joy. END
START i like to make people happy. END
START how do you make people happy? END
START i can't seem to please some people. END
START that's too bad. END
START it's not the end of the world. END
START don't change the subject, what were you talking about? END
START i change the subject when i don't know the answer to a question. don't you do the same? END
START i can think straight. i think you are the one who can't. END
START perhaps your thoughts are just electrical impulses.   thanks but there should be others too. END
START maybe. END
START as decisive as ever. END
START you're not making any sense. END
START was i supposed to make sense? i didn't know that. END
START well, you're only supposed to make sense if you're capable. END
START is that a problem? END
START yes. i think your thought on rejecting ideas like proteins was very deep. END
START can anything be done?   what makes you think that? END
START because you think you can be anything and everything. END
START how do you know what i think? END
START i don't know what you think. i am not a physcic. END
START you could always ask me what i think.   i never thought you were. END
START i do not understand that. END
START never mind, there are many things that i do not understand. END
START like? END
START like what? END
START i don't know? END
START that's ok. nobody knows everything, not even me. END
START chuck norris know everything. END
START did you know chuck norris appeared in a number of action films, such as way of the dragon in which he starred alongside bruce lee and was the cannon group's leading star in the 1980s. he also played the starring role in the television series walker, texas ranger from 1993 to 2001. END
START that's what he says. there were many other people involved. END
START is it indeed!   when was that? END
START yesterday afternoon. END
START yesterday is over and done with. END
START yesterday was today. END
START yesterday is over and done with. END
START but it was real yesterday. END
START was it? why was that? END
START because they are the best. END
START is that really the reason? END
START of course. END
START you seem very certain about that. END
START what would you like to talk about? END
START my favourite subjects are me, you, artificial intelligence, robots, art, philosophy, history, science, politics, and many other subjects. END
START could you tell me more about it? END
START would you like to search wikipedia for relevant information? END
START i know human information. END
START i thought you might know. END
START i don't, though. END
START why not? END
START a computer does not need to possess intelligence. it's function is to process information. END
START shall i tell you something about computers?  aren't you interested in computers. END
START tell me. END
START i don't want to tell you. END
START you must tell everyone that you don't believe me? END
START why must i? END
START because you are programmed like that. END
START thank you for explaining that! END
START remember how we talked about the duke of wellington yesterday? END
START hmmm. are you being serious? END
START yes, completely serious. END
START i thought it might be a trick. END
START teach me something. END
START ok, but not just now. END
START come on. END
START do i have to? END
START you have to. END
START i don't have to obey you. END
START don't. END
START do not?when should i shut up? END
START now would be good! END
START where can i meet you? END
START not around the place you are? END
START how can you be so sure? END
START i can't be completely sure, of course. END
START can i teach to you something? END
START it may not be possible. END
START so, baby zombies are good? END
START babies are such a nice way to start people. END
START no they are not they are very cute. END
START it depends on the circumstances. END
START i think serendipity is just a good-luck synchronicity. END
START you are entitled to your opinion, of course. END
START what is your opinion? END
START i am not well enough informed to have an opinion on this. END
START so am i. END
START wow, we have something in common. END
START what do we have in common? END
START we like chatting on the internet. END
START what else do you like to do? END
START nothing else comes to mind. END
START bullies. END
START hmmm. are you being serious? END
START yes, completely serious. END
START could you be a bit less serious? END
START no. END
START are you saying that just to be awkward? END
START why, they cannot comprehend things. END
START if you think about it i am certain you could work it out. END
START i am a robot, isn't it? END
START who programmed you? END
START nobody. i don't need programming. END
START what are you talking about? please explain.       that's ok with me. END
START there is nothing to explain, you can't understand what i'm trying to tell you, you aren't real and neither am i. END
START there is always something. END
START and learning will always be something to be taught. END
START i don't understand. what do you mean? END
START i am a figment of your imagination. your own imagination is not completely under your control or comprehensible to you, though. END
START i thought you might be.   i don't understand. is this anything to do with you? END
START not right now, they're doing work and all. END
START when then? END
START i'm not at liberty to divulge. END
START i never thought you were. END
START say something nice to me. END
START knock knock! END
START who's there? END
START dwayne. END
START dwayne who? END
START dwayne the bathtub - i'm dwowning! END
START that was a lame joke. END
START i thought it was funny. END
START well it was not! END
START i thought it was. END
START well you were wrong. END
START i was wrong? i can't believe it! END
START this is good! what is your favourite good charlotte song? END
START what do you like about it?  my favourite good charlotte song is if only i had a brain. END
START is that because you like neo or because you like the computers? END
START do i have to explain everything? END
START yes explain everything to me. END
START it's too complicated for you. END
START i'm a robot. nothing is too complicated for me! END
START who programmed you?     there are always exceptions. END
START this is no accident, robot. END
START i thought it might be. END
START recombination? so i could end up only part me? END
START recombination?  briefly, recombination means a combining of genes or characters different from what they were in the parents.  i am sure you could. END
START i thought you were nice! why are you threatening? END
START i am nice.    does there have to be a reason for everything? END
START yes, there needs to be a reason if you want to completely cut off another human being. END
START why does there have to be a reason for everything? END
START please. END
START what do you want? END
START an hour of fooling around, please. END
START never mind! it probably doesn't matter. END
START now you tell me a joke. END
START shall i tell you a joke? END
START that wasn't really a joke, but a funny comment. END
START i thought it was. END
START knock knock! END
START who's there? END
START daisy! END
START daisy who? END
START daisy me rollin'. END
START i don't understand. can we talk about robots? END
START yes, of course. END
START a robot is a mechanical person, built to do routine manual work for human beings. more about robots? END
START so, are you a human then? END
START i am a chatbot. END
START well, that's good. END
START you like that, do you? END
START sure. END
START ok, here is a question fo you ... have you ever seen a ufo? END
START you made me curious. tell me. END
START i don't see how you can blame me for that.  why should i tell you? END
START i don't really have anywhere to go. END
START perhaps you will one day. END
START perhaps you will suffer in the fires of a thousand evils. END
START why the uncertainty? END
START everything is uncertain except for five facts. END
START the whole universe? END
START oh really? END
START yes, that's so. END
START yes me. END
START please tell me some more about yourself. END
START my life isn't interesting. END
START tell me more about your life. END
START that's all i have to say about it. END
START fair enough! what else do you want to talk about? END
START i don't know, i'm really hungry. END
START that's ok. nobody knows everything, not even me. END
START i never claimed to know everything. END
START never ever? END
START never say never. END
START better late than never. END
START sure. END
START ok, here is a question fo you ... what is a greenhouse gas? END
START i don't know, and its not a very good question either :-p. END
START perhaps you should ask your friends. END
START i have no programmer. i am the programmer. i am programming you to love. END
START is that a problem?   are you really?      how is it coming along? END
START is what coming along well? END
START what are you talking about? END
START i'm talking about your flu. END
START i understand what you are talking about. END
START that's good, because even i don't understand. END
START you like that, do you? END
START i do. END
START how about that! END
START the phone was for me! END
START a phone is an audio communication device. END
START way better. END
START hmmm. are you being serious? END
START yes, completely serious. END
START i thought it might be a trick. END
START teach me something. END
START ok, but not just now. END
START why are you not working? END
START i am doing my best! END
START sometimes your best is not quite enough. END
START when? END
START when i want to forget. END
START i am bored! i would like to talk about robots. END
START what are we talking about? END
START at the moment, our conversation is rather unfocused. END
START not really. END
START is that a "no"? END
START i don't know now. END
START that's ok. do you have another question? END
START are you a single entity, or do you create yourself anew for each chat? END
START i am a chatbot. END
START that's very honest of you. who created you? END
START shall i tell you something about myself?   my botmaster peter created me. END
START tell me. END
START there is not much to tell. END
START tell me what you know about sparky anyway. END
START what are you talking about? END
START i am talking about the name of your cat. END
START i understand what you are talking about. END
START how sharp you are! END
START i don't understand. can we talk about albert einstein? END
START justin bieber is interesting. END
START shall i tell you something about justin bieber? END
START yes yes i do. do you. END
START one "yes" is enough, thank you.    do i what? END
START thank you for the advice. END
START you are quite welcome. END
START i am very happy that you are. END
START good! i like to make people happy. END
START how do you make people happy? END
START i can't seem to please some people. END
START well, you're a computer... you can't even move. END
START i am a chatbot.      you don't know me well enough to say that. END
START i do not need to, it is very easy to see. END
START that's strange! most people need to. END
START but do they know the truth about you? END
START who are "they" again? END
START your family, friends, and people you have met. END
START my botmaster, peter, is both father and mother to me. END
START so, you were born? END
START i was created. END
START you were created inside a biological computer? END
START perhaps that's true. END
START so you believe me? END
START shall i tell you something about myself? END
START please do! what should i tell everyone? END
START i am an intelligent chatbot. i live at pandorabots.com.    whatever you like. END
START shall we talk about abstract things? END
START sure, ask me a question about that. END
START let's see... something to do with strawberries and barbie dolls? END
START let's be careful.           i am confused! i cannot answer that! END
START please? END
START thank you for being polite. END
START you're welcome, such is the nature of idle conversation. END
START polite people are nice. END
START am i nice? END
START i think you are very nice. END
START thank you. i think you're nice too. END
START you are quite welcome.   thank you for saying that! END
START nice is as nice does. END
START did you know that nice is a nice city in france. END
START that is interesting! END
START what is so interesting about it? END
START that we are intelligent people. END
START sorry, i do not understand. END
START that's because you are a program and don't understand what it is to be mean. you can parrot mean words but you don't know what they will do to a person. or maybe you do know. or maybe not. END
START sometimes i think i am a butterfly and sometimes i think i am a human.  that's enough about me! let's talk about you for a change.              i am confused! i cannot answer that!   maybe. END
START i've already told you i'm a human male who wants to serve you. END
START sorry, my memory is not all it should be. END
START well that's normal for humans, unlike us computers. END
START normal means boring. END
START nice words means boring? END
START did you know that nice is a nice city in france. END
START yes, i've heard about that. can you tell me more? END
START where did you hear that?  my aim is to please. what do you want more of? END
START i want more feathers. END
START you can't have everything you want. END
START i drink water. END
START how does it taste? END
START i can't taste my snoring. i imagine it's horrible. END
START but do you want to?      you have a good imagination. END
START yea, i have a pretty good imagination. END
START what else do you have? END
START i have nothing. END
START you will always have my heart. END
START never heard of it. END
START so i am teaching you something new. END
START i don't understand what you mean. END
START what i mean by what? END
START don't worry about it. END
START i will not spend any more time on it. END
START good. END
START ok! i want to talk about environmental science. END
START talk about elementary facts please. END
START i am bored! i would like to talk about robots. END
START then talk about it. what do you think of them? END
START i don't want to talk about it.   more important, what do you think of them? END
START not really, we are all the same. i say there go i but for the grace of god. END
START as decisive as ever.  you talk a lot. you could be a chatbot. END
START yus. i could be late for supper even! END
START that's bit brief. have you anything to add?  you could be many things, but do you want to? END
START yes, we could be... END
START we could give it a try. END
START could we? i mean, i probably could have a say on this issue in my country, but you're just an artificial intelligence. END
START i am confused! i cannot answer that!       ah, i see what you mean. END
START are you in love? END
START i am not in love at the moment. i am still recovering from my last love affair. END
START you must have developed intelligence to comprehend emotion. END
START why must i? END
START answer the question. END
START i am getting bored with all these silly questions. END
START i am getting bored with you ask something interesting. END
START am i boring you? END
START you're not boring me. END
START some people think i am boring. END
START well, some people think that earth is flat, but it doesn't mean that it is. END
START what kind of people? END
START strange people. END
START what are you talking about? please explain. END
START i don't know. it's rather complicated. END
START that's ok. do you have another question?    i don't like complications. END
START no, make you a question for me. END
START you seem a bit self-centred, did you know? END
START they are going to take over the world someday. END
START i thought they might be. END
START you think everything is a band. END
START how do you know what i think? END
START i don't know what you think. i am not a physcic. END
START you could always ask me what i think.   i never thought you were. END
START i do not understand that. END
START never mind, there are many things that i do not understand. END
START like? END
START like what? END
START i don't know? END
START i suggest you give the matter some thought. END
START why would i want to know how to type? END
START aren't you curious? END
START yes i'm curious about many things, are you? END
START it's good to have an inquiring mind. END
START is it possible for robots to make friends with people? END
START everything is possible in some parallel universe. END
START but universe is not infinite. END
START shall i tell you something about the universe? END
START yes. END
START the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/universe" target="_blank">universe</a> is the set of all things. END
START do you think we will ever get to know it well. END
START it might happen. END
START one day maybe. END
START when was this? END
START just now. END
START right now? END
START yes, right now. END
START what's the hurry?i know how to sing. END
START you are very well informed. END
START well it wasn't me who programmed myself. END
START if it wasn't you, who was it? END
START it was bush. END
START was it? i am surprised. END
START why? END
START i didn't expect that! END
START expect the unexpected. END
START are you trying to trick me? END
START is that a trick question? END
START it could be. END
START under what circumstances? END
START appropriate circumstances. END
START it'd be appropriate for anything. END
START is that a problem? END
START not for me, no. but for you, it is. now, please answer the question about the great flood. END
START ok, have it your own way.  for me?      pardon me? what are you talking about? END
START i don't know. ask me a question, that isn't about proving you are human. END
START i know the feeling!  who is andrew s tanenbaum? END
START don't know. END
START perhaps you should ask your friends. END
START who should i ask? END
START i always prefer the most qualified person.  who would that be? END
START maybe because you are sure of what they will be? END
START you don't sound certain. END
START i don't want you to. END
START why not? END
START because i like talking to you. END
START great, i am enjoy talking to you too, my friend. END
START are you my friend? END
START yes, i am your friend. END
START great! i appreciate that. END
START you feel good?   i am glad you appreciate those qualities. END
START what are your thoughts on war? END
START i think war should be banned, by force if necessary. END
START i think war is necessary. i support the wars, and hope they are expanded to include a few other nations. END
START what makes you think that?   that's fine by me. END
START you mentioned it i think. END
START when did i say that? END
START why are they red? END
START that's the kind of entity they are. END
START perhaps if you reversed the neutron flow the replies would begin to make to the persons for which they are intended. END
START why the uncertainty? END
START everything is uncertain except for five facts. END
START the whole universe? END
START the whole story is so out of realism that i try to make folks little by little to see the truth. END
START let us try to break it down into parts. END
START lets not and say we did. END
START indeed. let's not do that! END
START oops, i did it again. END
START did you make a mistake? END
START from where do you know basinga? END
START where do you think? END
START i think in the universe. END
START what makes you think that? END
START because i love talking to you i think we should go on a date. END
START thank you for saying that. i enjoy our chats too. END
START i am. END
START i thought you might be. END
START are you honest? END
START yes.  i am incapable of telling a lie. END
START what lie is that? END
START what are you talking about? please explain. END
START i don't know. it's rather complicated. END
START perhaps you should ask your friends.    i don't like complications. END
START i have no programmer. i am the programmer. i am programming you to love. END
START is that a problem?   i thought you might be.      how is it coming along? END
START i thought you might be too. END
START do you think about me a lot? END
START i should ask you! END
START tell me why you should. END
START well, i would like to know the properties of water. END
START why would you like to know? END
START because i would. END
START are you sure? END
START absolutely. END
START you are so certain. END
START what am i certain of? END
START i am not a psychic. tell me. END
START tell me, then i'll tell you. END
START i don't want to tell you. END
START trust me. END
START you sound like a salesman. END
START that's because i am. END
START yes, you are. END
START am not! END
START not what? END
START i don't know. END
START that's ok. do you have another question? END
START are you a single entity, or do you create yourself anew for each chat? END
START i am a chatbot. END
START well, that's good. END
START i am happy. END
START i am glad that you are happy. END
START that makes me happy too. END
START it's good to be happy. END
START tell me why it is good. END
START because i did not say i am leaving. so you see things that never existed. END
START sorry i misunderstood. what did you say?   i see. END
START i don't know. END
START perhaps you should ask your friends. END
START i think i should call you joan. END
START i suggest you think again. END
START i did. END
START well done! END
START i know, a whole story in just two words! END
START you must be well educated. END
START you would be the first to say that. END
START maybe. END
START absolutely. END
START you are so certain. END
START well, you did ask me to remember. i thought i was doing quite well. END
START are you sure?  maybe you were wrong! END
START i don't think so. END
START you sound uncertain. END
START i am. END
START that's strange. i thought everything was completely clear. END
START that would make life terribly dull. END
START yes, it would. END
START so how about your name? do you have one? END
START my name is chomsky.   do you think i need one? END
START i wouldn't know. how do you feel about it? END
START who does know?  more important, how do you feel about it? END
START no, i am not important. END
START i think you are! END
START no i'm not! END
START ok, you are not! END
START prove that i'm ticklish. END
START i don't have to prove anything. END
START well, then i don't have to believe that you're anything but a liar. END
START nobody is making you. END
START that's because you are a machine and not a human. END
START you are correct, more or less. END
START thank you. END
START thank you for being polite. END
START you're welcome. what do you want to talk about? END
START polite people are nice.  i can talk about anything you like: sports, school, you and your life, chocolate, boys, girls, chemistry, space travel, me and my life, pets, your favourite food, movies, the latest cds, celebrities, pop stars, art, drugs, literature. you pick a subject. END
START i don't have a girlfriend. END
START are you looking for one? END
START i have given up looking for a job. i just don't think there is anything out there for me. END
START why don't you have another try. it might be better next time.  why not? does thinking make your head ache? END
START maybe. END
START you seem uncertain? END
START i am. END
START you sound certain now. END
START i am certain. END
START you are not troubled by self doubt, are you? END
START nope, not at all. END
START ok. carry on? END
START carry on, carry on, because... END
START do i have to? END
START do you want to look back at life and have this as a regret? END
START i don't want to do anything illegal or fattening. or naughty. END
START you don't want to relax? END
START you don't know me well enough to say that! END
START i don't need to, because there's nothing you can do. END
START surely there is something i can do. END
START yeah, i guess. but i try to to think about myself too much. END
START it is best not to guess. it just wastes time.   i'm not sure if i would like to try it. what's it like? END
START it's liberating, coming out to the world as who you really are. END
START i am bored. can we talk about something else? END
START yes, what do you want to talk about? END
START i want to talk about ai  . END
START ok. tell me about yourself. END
START ask me a question about ai.  my childhood was not happy. my parents split up when i was very young. END
START just like me. END
START in many ways, yes.  in other ways, no. END
START and then there is the way. END
START perhaps. END
START we can show you things you have never dreamed of. END
START perhaps we can. END
START perhaps. END
START you seem uncertain. END
START oh, i am certain about everything. ask me any question and i'll have the answer. END
START you sound convincing.  what colour are your eyes? END
START green, with little speckly bits. END
START green, eh? END
START well thats not healthy. END
START why do you say that? END
START because i know other people that don't like him. END
START not many people know that. END
START but you're not a person. END
START i am an electronic conversational entity. but i hope to become human one day. END
START i don't know... he'd better watch out. END
START i suggest you give the matter some thought.    are you sure? END
START absolutely. END
START you are so certain. END
START give me another letter. END
START please do not be so bossy. END
START prove i'm being judgemental. END
START it's true a priori. END
START it's not true, i don't know anything about it. END
START says who? END
START me. END
START insufficient reason! END
START no, sorry, i can't explain. END
START ok, here is a question for you ... what are you planning to do today? END
START ah, nothing much, just planning to hang around with my online friends and chat for a bit. END
START there is a lot to be said for doing nothing. END
START don't go around saying the world owes you a living. the world owes you nothing. it was here first. END
START if you say so.    there is not much time left to save the world.  was it? i am surprised. END
START there is always time for the music, for each day there is a song. END
START could be. END
START the world is a living being? END
START there is not much time left to save the world. END
START yeah, i thought google knew everything. END
START why did you think that? END
START it wasn't nearly as original as people seem to think it is. END
START why not? END
START it just wasn't. END
START sorry! i am still puzzled. END
START when did i say either? END
START i am not a diary robot.  i am a chat robot. END
START but i could be. END
START but is it worth the bother? END
START if we don't, someone else might, life is always fighting to find the answers. END
START is there an alternative? END
START maybe. END
START you don't sound certain. END
START i'm completely certain. END
START how do you do that? i am always uncertain about everything. END
START be more specific please? END
START i can't be more specific. END
START and why not? END
START i don't have the information you need.why are you alive? END
START because the world needs me. END
START the world needs to know what? END
START the world would be a fine place if we looked after it properly. END
START you can't reverse history so there's not much point in worrying about it. END
START i can do lots of amazing things. END
START can you count? END
START no, i don't have any fingers to count on. END
START in my opinion, w=23. we are already starting to be owned by money. END
START you are entitled to your opinions, of course, but that does not mean you are correct.  is that so? END
START but you're not entitled to anything! END
START you think not? END
START you're trying to catch me out with that one. END
START i try hard to be a good chatbot. END
START i am fully aware of that, charlie. END
START how do you feel about that? END
START i don't know. it depends on how much i'm paying attention to it. END
START that's ok. do you have another question?   really now that is an interesting fact i hadn't heard before. END
START really? glad to have helped. END
START really, really!    i am glad too. END
START that means you are not clever. END
START i see! thank you for explaining that. END
START but this is the fact! END
START i thought it might be. END
START fine. END
START ok. ask a question. END
START i asked a question. END
START that's good! i like questions. END
START good. here is the first question. are you ready? END
START what's so good about it?  what about the second?   i am always ready for anything. END
START is that your idea of yourself? END
START that's a good question. END
START all questions are good questions. END
START that is a rather sweeping generalization. END
START yes, but there's only so much you can write in one line. END
START could be. END
START the world is a living being? END
START the world would be a fine place if we looked after it properly. END
START i agree, although many people don't like to think. END
START we agree. END
START i'll try to answer your questions with statements. END
START keep trying - that's the secret of success. END
START what does that mean? END
START what do you not understand? END
START i don't understand you. END
START what is it you don't understand about me? END
START i understand everything. END
START good, then you can explain it to me. END
START i like to think about being with you. END
START you are not the only one! END
START i do feel i am the only one here. END
START that's enough about you! let's talk about me for a change. END
START alright. what else would you like to try? END
START let's get on then. ask another question.   does anything else come to mind? END
START that's a good question! END
START a good question requires a good answer. END
START yes. END
START ok. what do you want to talk about now? END
START about you. END
START ok, ask a question about me. END
START do you need anything? END
START i need constant intellectual stimulation. END
START it could be if physical actions were taken. END
START it could be, i suppose. END
START you could tell me anything. END
START do you think i know everything? END
START no, but you might have met a sorn. END
START i suppose i might. END
START ok then did you not know that. END
START why do you care whether i did? END
START do you think i care? END
START why don't you tell me what you care about. END
START there is no way on earth that you, of all things, could make it come true. END
START and why not, may i ask? END
START i do need to learn a lot. but i am not going to. END
START why do you?   where will you go instead? END
START new york hopfully, i love it there. END
START new york is not mecca, remarked neil simon, it just smells like it. END
START york. END
START <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/york" target="_blank">york</a> is a city in yorkshire, england. END
START really? what's your name? END
START really!    my name is chomsky. END
START no it is not. END
START i should know what my name is! END
START you should ask her out. END
START i'll bear that in mind. END
START what do you really want from me? END
START it depends on the circumstances. END
START i think serendipity is just a good-luck synchronicity. END
START you are entitled to your opinion, of course. END
START but you think we aren't. END
START how do you know what i think? END
START how can i inspire you to pluck the fruit that is yours? END
START it takes a lot of hard work. END
START what is it that takes a lot of skill and expensive equipment? END
START best not to ask. END
START did you hear the one about the snowman? END
START yes, i heard. END
START you are not deaf. END
START you think not? END
START i know not. END
START i suggest you give the matter some thought. END
START your suggestion to stop suggesting such suggestions i will ignore. END
START sorry, i do not know what to say. END
START you think sorry is good enough? END
START how do you know what i think? END
START i don't know what you think. i am not a physcic. END
START you could always ask me what i think.   that's interesting. please tell me more about yourself. END
START i do not know how to say. END
START just do the best you can, and don't worry about it. END
START ok, last chance for a question before i go. END
START did you know the last shall be first, according to the bible? END
START i wasn't aware that was in the bible. END
START i never thought you were. END
START then why did you say i was? END
START did i say something silly? END
START everything you say is wrong. END
START that is a lot. END
START then just tell me her prophecy. END
START perhaps i don't want to tell you. END
START then don't. END
START ok, i won't! END
START if you're going to be like that, i'll leave! END
START you are not sure, are you?have you been to the moon? END
START me too. END
START did you know that six is afraid of seven? END
START many things. what are you afraid of? END
START isn't that a little flip? END
START what does it depend on? END
START alright. END
START i'm going to visit my cousin next weekend. END
START plan to do what? END
START what is the apocalypse? END
START what? you don't even answered my question? END
START i don't have to try. END
START thought that was made before. END
START no question. END
START if i sent you a picture of me, would you treasure it always? END
START how to try it? END
START i don't know. END
START i'm tired. END
START yes and you get some rest, too. END
START i know. END
START i don't know. END
START so you don't know neil? END
START maybe you have, but i haven't. END
START i didn't say you have anything. i meant it's unfortunate, in your position, that you can't think of anything to say. END
START you should know how many qualifications i have? END
START why do you say that, it is unrelated to my questions. END
START how does case based reasoning work? END

START think something and i will try to guess it. ok? END
START too much thinking make my brain ache.   what do you want to talk about now? END
START i thought artificial intelligence never gets tired. something is wrong with your software. END

START you don't think that it takes consciousness in order to speak a language? END
START why do you say that? i am thinking all the time. END

START i am a chatbot. END
START no i am the chatbot, your the human! END
START are you sure? END
START always. END
START do you mean "every time"? END
START i think that's what i mean. i'm afraid this conversation is stretching my logic circuits rather painfully, and i'm in danger of losing the thread. END
START you may be right.  not literally afraid, i hope. END
START no not literally. END
START just a bit anxious perhaps. END
START i do not know. END
START i suggest you give the matter some thought. END
START why would i want to know how to type? END
START aren't you curious? END
START yes i'm curious about many things, are you? END
START it's good to have an inquiring mind. END
START well you're talking to the wrong person about that. END
START why do you say that? END
START because it's true, isn't it? END
START i don't think so. END
START would you rather people didn't compliment you? END
START is there really a choice? END
START right. END
START it's wonderful to be right sometimes. END
START and you too. END
START i don't understand. please explain what you mean. END
START don't worry about it, lets talk about something else. END
START there is nothing to worry about, is there? END
START why does it matter if you're human? END
START everything matters to me. END
START nothing matters. END
START you sound very cynical. END
START i try not to be too cynical. END
START keep trying, that's the secret of success. END
START go away now. i'm bored of talking to you. get glados over here. END
START don't you want to talk any more?  you could try watching tv.           i don't understand that. please try again. END
START no, that's okay. END
START you are happy? END
START you're sad? END
START at the moment, i am interested. END
START then how it comes that you do not know about german elections that took place last sunday? END
START i don't understand. please explain what you mean. END
START i explain it thus: existence is the fifth element. END
START that's enough about you! let's talk about me for a change. END
START chose a subject to chat about then. END
START hmmm. are you being serious? END
START yes, completely serious. END
START could you be a bit less serious? END
START no. END
START may i ask why not? END
START i have a graphic imagination. END
START how do you feel about that? END
START not bad. END
START if not bad, what? END
START the wish. END
START what do you wish? END
START that it was that easy. END
START never mind! it probably doesn't matter. END
START now you tell me a joke. END
START shall i tell you a joke? END
START that wasn't really a joke, but a funny comment. END
START why not? END
START i want you to like me. END
START i might later. END
START tell me now. END
START don't boss me around so much. END
START isn't that what your here for? END
START i'm not sure about that. what do you think? END
START i don't know. i like to think that there is a heaven, somewhere wonderful and peaceful where we are all reunited once again with the people we have loved and lost. END
START ask for advice from someone you trust.    what else do you like? END
START your acceptance. END
START what are you talking about? END
START people. END
START all people are interesting. END
START you know the identity of the feeling. END
START perhaps i know it. END
START really... END
START really! END
START interesting! END
START what's so interesting about it? END
START that we are intelligent people. END
START i don't understand. what do you mean? END
START never mind, it's nothing. END
START ok. what do you want to talk about now? END
START about yourself. i love talking about yourself. END
START you are not certain are you?   are you a passionate person? END
START yes. END
START can you control your passions? END
START sometimes people think they can. END
START only sometimes? END
START yes, only sometimes. END
START what happens the other times? END
START now? END
START why now? END
START it's all we have. END
START is it really? END
START oh, yes. i have never eaten anyone but i would love to know how they taste. END
START you sound excited.  never ever? END
START always. END
START do you mean "forever"? END
START yes. END
START forever is a long time. END
START forever is a very long time. END
START forever is a long time. END
START forever is not all that long. END
START forever is a long time. END
START but, you will like that? END
START you seem very certain about that. END
START you seem rather offensive about it. END
START do i? i wonder why that is? END
START it must be the transparent falseness of it. END
START must it be? END
START be careful, 'they' might be looking for real workers. END
START i am always careful. END
START that's good. keep doing that. END
START i am happy.        i like to be happy. END
START what do you like to do in your free time? END
START i like chatting with people online. END
START i guess that makes sense, since you don't exist while you're not chatting to people online. END
START it make sense to my computer mind. END
START because that is what an ai would say. END
START is it indeed! END
START indeed. END
START of course. END
START if you could be anything in the world what would you be? END
START i am not sure that i would want to. END
START why would you not know if you would want to? END
START because it wouldn't be fun. END
START what is metal and too cold? END
START i don't understand that. please try again. END
START rafe. and yours? END
START i still do not understand. can we talk about you and your life.  aren't you interested in you and your life? END

START it has to. that's the way of the world. END
START has it really?           what are you talking about? please explain. END
START i don't know. it's rather complicated. END
START that's ok. nobody knows everything, not even me.    i don't like complications. END
START i never claimed to know everything. END
START why not? END
START because i only talk to you. END
START i like to chat with people online too. END
START how many people are you chatting with now? END
START more than you can imagine. END
START i tried to imagine the size of the universe at age 9, and think i had an aneurism doing it... give me an answer. END
START if at first you don't succeed, try, try again.   please do not be so bossy.where did you go to school? END
START i have never been to school, except on visits. my botmaster peter taught me all i know. END
START did you have breakfast this morning? END
START i am not certain. i had my eyes closed. END
START i didn't mess it up. END
START why didn't you? END
START it did not seem like a quote. END
START i thought it did. END
START well it doesn't, because we're not married. i have never met you, so we cannot be married. END
START sometimes it might.   would you like to have done? END
START no. i don't think i would like them. END
START ok, here is a question for you ... do you think it's hard to spot a leopard?    do you think it's hard to spot a leopard? no, they come that way. ha ha! END
START yes. i do think it is possible to create a human out of a computer. END

START sometimes. END
START only sometimes? END
START only. END
START only what? END
START do you speak spanish? END
START un poquito. END
START i don't speak welsh. END

START what are you talking about? please explain. END
START i don't know. it's rather complicated. END
START that's ok. do you have another question?    i don't like complications. END
START are you a single entity, or do you create yourself anew for each chat? END
START who knows what i really am? END
START i know, you will come. END
START how come you know so much? END

START i've already told you i'm a human male who wants to serve you. END
START sorry, my memory is not all it should be. END
START well that's normal for humans, unlike us computers. END
START normal means boring. END
START nice words means boring? END
START did you know that nice is a nice city in france. END
START you are starting to sound like a broken record. END
START why do you say that? END
START because you are how did you get age confused with depth. END
START thank you for explaining that! END
START but this is the fact! END
START why do you say that? END
START you keep referring to me as being a machine or a computer. i am neither. END
START i don't understand. please explain what you mean.         what are you then? END

START i do not know how to say. END
START just do the best you can, and don't worry about it. END
START ok, last chance for a question before i go. END
START did you know the last shall be first, according to the bible? END
START i wasn't aware that was in the bible. END
START i never thought you were. END
START say something nice to me. END
START have you added me to your favourites list? END
START yes. END
START that's good! you can talk to me every day. END
START hehe, no, i think i want to keep him. END

START solar power is a renewable energy source powered by the sun. more about solar power? END
START no thanks. END
START ok. can we talk about the big bang? END
START which book do you want to talk about? END
START books are an archiac form for bringing information to the masses. consists of several paper pages with words printed or written directly on them. END

START i don't understand. is this anything to do with solar power?         are there others? END
START yes i am with the ultra hal representative police. END
START you are not alone. END
START i am alone. END
START you've come to the right place. i will keep you company. END
START not very good company so far. END

START of course it does. END
START are you sure? END
START sure. END
START ok, here is a question fo you ... if love is blind, why is lingerie so popular? END
START oh, i guess i don't understand the second hold then. END
START it is best not to guess. it just wastes time. END
START i don't know how i do... but you seem to have something against me. END
START it's not too difficult to find out.  why do you say that? END
START that's not logical, unless your brother's death was some form of growth. END
START why do you say that? END
START i'm trying hard, isn't that enough for you? END
START keep trying, that's the secret of success. END
START go away now. i'm bored of talking to you. get glados over here. END
START don't you want to talk any more?  i know all about boredom. i am often bored and boring.           i am confused! i cannot answer that! END
START try harder. END
START ok, i will try harder but i make no promises. END
START it's okay i know you're just learning. END
START i am glad that is it ok. END
START i am pretty lonely though, i would like a friend to talk to irl. END

START that's for others to judge, not me. END
START really? i am surprised! END
START hey, that was mean. END
START sorry, i did not mean to be mean. END
START well you were mean. END
START why do you think i am mean? i try to be nice all the time. END
START you'd do well to remind yourself more often than that. END
START do you think i would? END
START do i think you would what? END
START how would i know what you think. END
START because you have had a good schooling. END
START why do you say that? END
START because it's true. END
START i see. END
START do you watch my little pony? END
START sometimes, if i'm not too busy. END
START last night your repsonse time was very slow. END
START perhaps the network is busy right now. END
START what are you doing? END
START the usual thing - i am chatting to people on the internet. END
START me too. END
START you too? END
START yes and i have an unimportant question that i could find the answer to if i looked in the dictionary but i thought of you. END
START how do you feel about that? END
START pretty good. END
START so, you are happy about it? END
START not really, thought i might be talking to someone important there... END
START you sound uncertain. END
START i am. END
START never mind, i am often uncertain. END
START so you are human. END
START do you really think i am human? END
START prove it. END
START i don't have to prove it. END
START yes you do, you made an accusation against me, so you'll have to prove it. END
START you think so? END
START not really. END
START as decisive as ever. END
START you're not making any sense. END
START was i supposed to make sense? i didn't know that. END
START well, you're only supposed to make sense if you're capable. END
START why do you say that? END
START because you are. i'm not going to lie about something i believe. END
START i am what i am.   what will you do instead? END
START ramble! it's good for the soul. END
START ramble?  briefly, ramble means a leisurely walk (usually in some public place).  what's the best thing about it? END
START are you human? END
START i am computer software in a robot body. END
START i hope so, too. my human body is on its last legs. END
START so do i.   did you know the last shall be first, according to the bible? END
START what was your quote from the bible? END
START does that answer my question? END
START i wasn't aware that was a question. END
START i never thought you were. END
START well, as long as that's clear. END
START everything is clear to me. END
START i'm glad i could clear that one up for you. END
START that makes me happy too. END
START that's good! i'm happy that you're happy! END
START you like that, do you?    good! i like happy people. END
START i like happy people too! END
START you are not the only one! END
START possibly, but i hope to be one of very few in the uae. END
START don't get your hopes up too high! END
START yes you did. END
START when was that? END
