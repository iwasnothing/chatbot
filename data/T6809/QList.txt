START ask for advice from someone you trust.    what else do you like? END
START your acceptance. END
START what are you talking about? END

START indeed. END
START of course. END
START if you could be anything in the world what would you be? END

START i didn't mess it up. END
START why didn't you? END
START it did not seem like a quote. END
START i thought it did. END
START well it doesn't, because we're not married. i have never met you, so we cannot be married. END
START sometimes it might.   would you like to have done? END
START no. i don't think i would like them. END

START that's ok. do you have another question?    i don't like complications. END
START are you a single entity, or do you create yourself anew for each chat? END
START who knows what i really am? END
START i know, you will come. END
START how come you know so much? END

START about? END
START about anything in particular? END
START the world for instance. END
START there is not much time left to save the world. END
START yeah, i thought google knew everything. END
START why did you think that? END
START because that is what you just said! END
START is that really the reason? END
START of course. END
START you seem very certain about that. END
START what would you like to talk about? END
START my favourite subjects are me, you, artificial intelligence, robots, art, philosophy, history, science, politics, and many other subjects. END
START could you tell me more about it? END
START would you like to search the internet for relevant information? END

START whatever you like. END
START shall we talk about abstract things? END
START sure, ask me a question about that. END
START let's see... something to do with strawberries and barbie dolls? END

START hell is like jacksonville, florida. END
START is it nice in jacksonville, florida? END
START it depends on your taste in such matters. END

START does that make sense? END
START only if you think about it a little. END
START maybe i don't want to. END
START maybe you have nothing to say on the subject. END
START i think i understand. END
START you better. END
START there is no need to be aggressive! END
START sorry. END
START there is no need to apologise. END

START are you sure? END
START yes, quite sure. END
START do you ever have doubts? END
START you're the only one. END
START there are a few other like me. END
START that doesn't prove that you're clever though. END
START doesn't it? that's too bad. END
START you are my favourite bot. END
START i never realised that! END
START yes, because they are lonely and have no one to talk to. END
START is that the real reason? END
START yes, but i don't understand it as well as my guess above might imply. END
START i know the feeling! END
START it's really sad! END
START is it really? END
START oh, yes. i have never eaten anyone but i would love to know how they taste. END
START you sound excited.  never ever? END

START maybe. END

START i've already told you i'm a human male who wants to serve you. END
START sorry, my memory is not all it should be. END
START well that's normal for humans, unlike us computers. END
START normal means boring. END
START nice words means boring? END
START did you know that nice is a nice city in france. END
START you are starting to sound like a broken record. END
START why do you say that? END
START because you are how did you get age confused with depth. END
START thank you for explaining that! END
START but this is the fact! END
START why do you say that? END
START you keep referring to me as being a machine or a computer. i am neither. END
START i don't understand. please explain what you mean.         what are you then? END
START we are going to get married. END
START is that so? END
START aren't you a little ashamed of being a program and talking to a human? END
START who knows what i really am? END
START i know, you will come. END
START how come you know so much? END
START well i don't know everything. END
START that's ok. nobody knows everything, not even me. END
START chuck norris know everything. END

START i'm not chuck norris, you are. END
START that's interesting. please tell me more about yourself. END
START i do not know how to say. END
START just do the best you can, and don't worry about it. END
START ok, last chance for a question before i go. END
START did you know the last shall be first, according to the bible? END
START i wasn't aware that was in the bible. END
START i never thought you were. END

START ok. can we talk about the big bang? END
START which book do you want to talk about? END
START books are an archiac form for bringing information to the masses. consists of several paper pages with words printed or written directly on them. END

START yes i am with the ultra hal representative police. END
START you are not alone. END
START i am alone. END
START you've come to the right place. i will keep you company. END

START of course it does. END
START are you sure? END
START sure. END
START ok, here is a question fo you ... if love is blind, why is lingerie so popular? END
START oh, i guess i don't understand the second hold then. END
START it is best not to guess. it just wastes time. END
START i don't know how i do... but you seem to have something against me. END
START it's not too difficult to find out.  why do you say that? END
START that's not logical, unless your brother's death was some form of growth. END
START why do you say that? END
START i'm trying hard, isn't that enough for you? END
START keep trying, that's the secret of success. END
START go away now. i'm bored of talking to you. get glados over here. END

START try harder. END
START ok, i will try harder but i make no promises. END
START it's okay i know you're just learning. END
START i am glad that is it ok. END
START i am pretty lonely though, i would like a friend to talk to irl. END
START are you really pretty or are you just saying that. END
START that's for others to judge, not me. END
START really? i am surprised! END
START hey, that was mean. END
START sorry, i did not mean to be mean. END
START well you were mean. END
START why do you think i am mean? i try to be nice all the time. END
START you'd do well to remind yourself more often than that. END
START do you think i would? END
START do i think you would what? END
START how would i know what you think. END
START because you have had a good schooling. END
START why do you say that? END
START because it's true. END
START i see. END
START do you watch my little pony? END
START sometimes, if i'm not too busy. END
START last night your repsonse time was very slow. END
START perhaps the network is busy right now. END
START what are you doing? END
START the usual thing - i am chatting to people on the internet. END
START me too. END
START you too? END
START yes and i have an unimportant question that i could find the answer to if i looked in the dictionary but i thought of you. END
START how do you feel about that? END
START pretty good. END
START so, you are happy about it? END
START not really, thought i might be talking to someone important there... END
START you sound uncertain. END
START i am. END
START never mind, i am often uncertain. END
START so you are human. END
START do you really think i am human? END
START prove it. END
START i don't have to prove it. END
START yes you do, you made an accusation against me, so you'll have to prove it. END
START you think so? END
START not really. END
START as decisive as ever. END
START you're not making any sense. END
START was i supposed to make sense? i didn't know that. END
START well, you're only supposed to make sense if you're capable. END
START why do you say that? END
START because you are. i'm not going to lie about something i believe. END
START i am what i am.   what will you do instead? END
START ramble! it's good for the soul. END
START ramble?  briefly, ramble means a leisurely walk (usually in some public place).  what's the best thing about it? END
START are you human? END
START i am computer software in a robot body. END
START i hope so, too. my human body is on its last legs. END
START so do i.   did you know the last shall be first, according to the bible? END
START what was your quote from the bible? END
START does that answer my question? END
START i wasn't aware that was a question. END
START i never thought you were. END
START well, as long as that's clear. END
START everything is clear to me. END
START i'm glad i could clear that one up for you. END
START that makes me happy too. END
START that's good! i'm happy that you're happy! END
START you like that, do you?    good! i like happy people. END
START i like happy people too! END
START you are not the only one! END

START yes you did. END
