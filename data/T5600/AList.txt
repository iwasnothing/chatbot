START tell me, then i'll tell you. END
START i don't want to tell you. END
START trust me. END
START you sound like a salesman. END
START that's because i am. END
START yes, you are. END
START am not! END
START not what? END
START i don't know. END
START that's ok. do you have another question? END
START are you a single entity, or do you create yourself anew for each chat? END
START i am a chatbot. END
START well, that's good. END
START i am happy. END
START i am glad that you are happy. END
START that makes me happy too. END
START it's good to be happy. END
START tell me why it is good. END
START because i did not say i am leaving. so you see things that never existed. END
START sorry i misunderstood. what did you say?   i see. END
START i don't know. END
START perhaps you should ask your friends. END
START i think i should call you joan. END
START i suggest you think again. END
START i did. END
START well done! END
START i know, a whole story in just two words! END
START you must be well educated. END
START you would be the first to say that. END
START maybe. END
START absolutely. END
START you are so certain. END
START well, you did ask me to remember. i thought i was doing quite well. END
START are you sure?  maybe you were wrong! END
START i don't think so. END
START you sound uncertain. END
START i am. END
START that's strange. i thought everything was completely clear. END
START that would make life terribly dull. END
START yes, it would. END
START so how about your name? do you have one? END
START my name is chomsky.   do you think i need one? END
START i wouldn't know. how do you feel about it? END
START who does know?  more important, how do you feel about it? END
START no, i am not important. END
START i think you are! END
START no i'm not! END
START ok, you are not! END
START prove that i'm ticklish. END
START i don't have to prove anything. END
START well, then i don't have to believe that you're anything but a liar. END
START nobody is making you. END
START that's because you are a machine and not a human. END
START you are correct, more or less. END
START thank you. END
START thank you for being polite. END
START you're welcome. what do you want to talk about? END
START polite people are nice.  i can talk about anything you like: sports, school, you and your life, chocolate, boys, girls, chemistry, space travel, me and my life, pets, your favourite food, movies, the latest cds, celebrities, pop stars, art, drugs, literature. you pick a subject. END
START i don't have a girlfriend. END
START are you looking for one? END
START i have given up looking for a job. i just don't think there is anything out there for me. END
START why don't you have another try. it might be better next time.  why not? does thinking make your head ache? END
START maybe. END
START you seem uncertain? END
START i am. END
START you sound certain now. END
START i am certain. END
START you are not troubled by self doubt, are you? END
START nope, not at all. END
START ok. carry on? END
START carry on, carry on, because... END
START do i have to? END
START do you want to look back at life and have this as a regret? END
START i don't want to do anything illegal or fattening. or naughty. END
START you don't want to relax? END
START you don't know me well enough to say that! END
START i don't need to, because there's nothing you can do. END
START surely there is something i can do. END
START yeah, i guess. but i try to to think about myself too much. END
START it is best not to guess. it just wastes time.   i'm not sure if i would like to try it. what's it like? END
START it's liberating, coming out to the world as who you really are. END
START i am bored. can we talk about something else? END
START yes, what do you want to talk about? END
START i want to talk about ai  . END
START ok. tell me about yourself. END
START ask me a question about ai.  my childhood was not happy. my parents split up when i was very young. END
START just like me. END
START in many ways, yes.  in other ways, no. END
START and then there is the way. END
START perhaps. END
START we can show you things you have never dreamed of. END
START perhaps we can. END
START perhaps. END
START you seem uncertain. END
START oh, i am certain about everything. ask me any question and i'll have the answer. END
START you sound convincing.  what colour are your eyes? END
START green, with little speckly bits. END
START green, eh? END
START well thats not healthy. END
START why do you say that? END
