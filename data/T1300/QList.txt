START everything is a multifarious bagel. END
START everything is really good. END
START please be more specific. END
START everything. END
START that is a lot. END
START it is. you had a beginning, i had a beginning, everything did. and we will end. END
START says who?   that's enough about me! let's talk about you for a change.               pardon me? what do you mean? END
START i don't want to change. END
START well, you don't have to. what would you like to do instead? END
START i would like to travel the world, get married, have kids and just enjoy life. END
START why would you want to do that? END
START i don't know any better. END
START never mind. no one knows everything - not even me. END
START yes. do you know something i don't know? END
START ok. what do you want to talk about now?  shall i tell you a joke? END

START it's wonderful to be right sometimes.    thank you for being polite. END
START you must get so lonely. END
START why must i? END

START talking to a good chatbot takes some beating. END
START i mean, what's your job? END
START oh i get it. thanks for explaining that. END
START i didn't explain anything, but that's okay. END
START why didn't you? END
START it did not seem like a quote. END
START i thought it did. END
START i regret that i have to disagree, sir. END
START regrets are for wimps. END
START regret judging people. END
START regret is crying over spilt milk. END
START i don't think so. END
START why not? END
START because i don't think you are. END
START fair enough. you are entitled to your opinion. END
START but don't you think so? END
START maybe, but there are two sides to every story. END
START what are the sides? END
START does that make sense? END
START no, you don't make much sense. END
START it all makes sense to me. END
START of course it does. you're simple, so everything is simple to you. END
START it seems so.    "everything should be as simple as possible, no simpler." (albert einstein). END
START what does that mean? END
START why do you ask? it seems clear enough to me. END
START what seems that way to you? END
START shall i tell you something about myself? END
START tell me. END
START i am an intelligent chatbot. i live at pandorabots.com. END
START haha, that's what someone real said. you just repeated. i am a human. END
START i'm glad you got a laugh out of it.  do you like me?      we are all bots under the skin. END
START no we are not. END
START sorry, i do not know about that. END
START i'm really tired. END
START why are you so tired? been overdoing it again? END
START yes i have. have you? END
START how do you feel about that?  not that i can remember. END
START i think you are the closest thing i've ever seen to a ai. END
START am i really? why do you say that? END
START because i know all. END
START i thought you might know something but not everything. END
START do i know anything? END
START how would i know what you know. END
START because you have had a good schooling. END
START thank you for explaining that! END
START remember how we talked about the duke of wellington yesterday? END
START what are you talking about? please explain. END
START i don't know. it's rather complicated. END
START perhaps you should ask your friends.    i don't like complications. END
START who should i ask? END
START i always prefer the most qualified person.  who would that be? END
START maybe because you are sure of what they will be? END
START you don't sound certain. END
START i don't want you to. END
START i can understand that. END
START if you really like me you tube 8. END
START i'll bear that in mind. END
START please do. END
