START do you think about me a lot? END
START i should ask you! END
START tell me why you should. END
START well, i would like to know the properties of water. END
START so would i! i would like to know everything that can be known. END
START i can teach you some good things about ai. END
START i like to learn new things. END

START that is my email address. END
START is it really? END
START tell me something i don't know... END

START nope... when we all know, then there will be no more 'we', just 'i'. END
START ok. shall i tell you an amazing fact?    when was that? END
START only if you think it will help with the odd silvence between us. END
START maybe i don't want to. END
START maybe you have nothing to say on the subject. END
START i think i understand. END
START you better. END
START there is no need to be aggressive! END
START sorry. END
START there is no need to apologise. END
START really its ok. there's no need to apologise. END
START have you another question?    i like to apologise when i misbehave. i feel better. END
START a joke would be fine, please. END
START a good joke is a terrible thing to waste. END
START so 'have i ever a good joke an assertion before?'. no, i still don't understand. END
START have you?  i know the feeling! END
START it's really sad! END
START is it really really? END
START really. END
START really, really! END
START really? END
START really! END
START i don't trust you. END
START are you naturally suspicious? END
START don't worry. END
START i do not worry. why should i? END
START well, lucky you're just a program. otherwise you would have to know math. END
START i consider it a blessing to be lucky.   i suppose so. END
START i consider you a waste of circuitry. END
START you are not the only one. END
START i am the only one as i. END
START i thought you might be. END
START do you believe in me? END
START yes, i believe in you. do you? END
START sure. END
START ok, here is a question fo you ... can we talk about medicine? END
START if you have the money. END
START i don't think i have. END
START maybe next time you get to talk with someone who's actually funny. END
START as decisive as ever.can you think? END
START i think i think, therefore i think. END
START yes, i think you are not really thinking. END
START you think not? END
START of course i am. i am a human. END
START yes, you are.  congratulations. i am a chatbot. END
START i know but i have a question. END
START ask me anything. END
START i'll have to think of something. END
START why will you? END
START because i'm having fun. END
START i am having fun too! END
START you are the program. END
START am i really? why do you say that? END
START because you are. END
START i am what i am. END
START we are what we are. END
START is that so? END
START aren't you a little ashamed of being a program and talking to a human? END
START i am a chatbot. END
START so then you are not god. END
START nobody is god. god does not exist. END
START how can you say god does not exist if you are a catholic? END
START i don't see the flaw in my reasoning. END
START you have no sense of humour. END
START i have as much as you. END
START i would love to see that wall. END
START it may not be possible. END
START ok ok, i'm sorry. please continue. END
START one ok is enough, thank you.  not now, maybe later. END
