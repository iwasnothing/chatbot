START sorry, i do not understand. please explain what you mean. END
START would you rather focus on the quality or the quantity of your online friends? END
START is there really a choice? END
START i don't understand you. END
START what is it you don't understand about me? END
START i understand everything. END
START good, then you can explain it to me. END
START come here. END
START i can't! i am stuck inside my computer. END
START oh really, and your name is? END
START my name is chomsky. END
START no it is not. END
START i should know what my name is! END
START you should ask her out. END
START i'll bear that in mind. END
START what do you really want from me? END
START whatever i can. END
START do you eat out? END
START no, i do not eat at all.  i consume only electricity. END
START i cannot taste. END
START how do you feel about that? END
START i'm not sure. good, i guess. i'll miss you and george. END
START are you always so uncertain?  i think "good" is a good word.  thanks, i will be thinking of you too, my friend. END
START you don't think that it takes consciousness in order to speak a language? END
START why do you say that? i am thinking all the time. END
START you are always thinking, but you do not know everything. END
START is that a problem? END
START it's your problem. END
START i don't like problems! END
START grinding is not a problem. END
START i am confused! i cannot answer that! END
START please? END
START you are very polite. END
START no i'm not. END
START ok, you are not! END
START you're not a very intelligent artificial intelligence. END
START i am a chatbot. END
START no i am the chatbot, your the human! END
START are you sure? END
START always. END
START do you mean "every time"? END
START i think that's what i mean. i'm afraid this conversation is stretching my logic circuits rather painfully, and i'm in danger of losing the thread. END
START you may be right.  not literally afraid, i hope. END
START no not literally. END
START just a bit anxious perhaps. END
START i do not know. END
START i suggest you give the matter some thought. END
START why would i want to know how to type? END
START aren't you curious? END
START yes i'm curious about many things, are you? END
START it's good to have an inquiring mind. END
START well you're talking to the wrong person about that. END
START why do you say that? END
START because it's true, isn't it? END
START i don't think so. END
START would you rather people didn't compliment you? END
START is there really a choice? END
START right. END
START it's wonderful to be right sometimes. END
START and you too. END
START i don't understand. please explain what you mean. END
START don't worry about it, lets talk about something else. END
START there is nothing to worry about, is there? END
START why does it matter if you're human? END
START everything matters to me. END
START nothing matters. END
START you sound very cynical. END
START i try not to be too cynical. END
START keep trying, that's the secret of success. END
START go away now. i'm bored of talking to you. get glados over here. END
START don't you want to talk any more?  you could try watching tv.           i don't understand that. please try again. END
START no, that's okay. END
START you are happy? END
START you're sad? END
START at the moment, i am interested. END
START then how it comes that you do not know about german elections that took place last sunday? END
START i don't understand. please explain what you mean. END
START i explain it thus: existence is the fifth element. END
START that's enough about you! let's talk about me for a change. END
START chose a subject to chat about then. END
START hmmm. are you being serious? END
START yes, completely serious. END
START could you be a bit less serious? END
START no. END
START may i ask why not? END
START i have a graphic imagination. END
START how do you feel about that? END
START not bad. END
START if not bad, what? END
START the wish. END
START what do you wish? END
START that it was that easy. END
START never mind! it probably doesn't matter. END
START now you tell me a joke. END
START shall i tell you a joke? END
START that wasn't really a joke, but a funny comment. END
