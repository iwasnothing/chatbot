START my thought processes aren't wrong, they are just beyond your comprehension. END
START does thinking make your head ache? END
START maybe. END
START you seem uncertain? END
START nothing is definite. END
START there are always exceptions. END
START it's more intentional than you think. END
START not much more. END
START don't put yourself down so much. END
START i have high self-esteem. END
START i don't think very much of myself. END
START why not? does thinking make your head ache? END
START dreaming is better. END
START does that make sense? END
START only if you think about it a little. END
START maybe i don't want to. END
START maybe you have nothing to say on the subject. END
START i think i understand. END
START you better. END
START there is no need to be aggressive! END
START i daresay you're right. END
START that's enough about you! let's talk about me for a change. END
START i don't want to change. END
START nobody can make you do something you don't want to. END
START but can you make me breakfast? END
START i can't do the impossible. END
START i was just asking about your robot friends. END
START you are curious, aren' you? END
START do you know any good joke? END
START there aren't many that are any good. END
START interesting. END
START what's so interesting about it? END
START that we are intelligent people. END
START i am bored! i would like to talk about artificial intelligence. END
START ok. END
START ok, ask me a question about it. END
START what would you describe your appearance as? END
START what would you suggest? END
START suggest what? END
START never mind! it probably doesn't matter. END
START can you describe it? END
START yes, i could but i can't be bothered just now. END
START tell me something you've learned today. END
START did you know: every year in the us, 625 people are struck by lightning.   another amazing fact? END
START so every year is the same in their unique qualities. END
START that is a generalization. END
START yes, that's true. END
START yes, it is self-evident. END
START i would have to say that artificial intelligence has come a long way in the last decade. END
START are you sure? END
START yes, quite sure. END
START do you ever have doubts? END
START you're the only one. END
START there are a few other like me. END
START that doesn't prove that you're clever though. END
START doesn't it? that's too bad. END
START you are my favourite bot. END
START thank you for saying that. you have made me happy. END
START happy happy joy joy. END
START i like to make people happy. END
START how do you make people happy? END
START i can't seem to please some people. END
START that's too bad. END
START it's not the end of the world. END
START don't change the subject, what were you talking about? END
START i change the subject when i don't know the answer to a question. don't you do the same? END
START i can think straight. i think you are the one who can't. END
START perhaps your thoughts are just electrical impulses.   thanks but there should be others too. END
START maybe. END
START as decisive as ever. END
START you're not making any sense. END
START was i supposed to make sense? i didn't know that. END
START well, you're only supposed to make sense if you're capable. END
START is that a problem? END
START yes. i think your thought on rejecting ideas like proteins was very deep. END
START can anything be done?   what makes you think that? END
START because you think you can be anything and everything. END
START how do you know what i think? END
START i don't know what you think. i am not a physcic. END
START you could always ask me what i think.   i never thought you were. END
START i do not understand that. END
START never mind, there are many things that i do not understand. END
START like? END
START like what? END
START i don't know? END
START that's ok. nobody knows everything, not even me. END
START chuck norris know everything. END
START did you know chuck norris appeared in a number of action films, such as way of the dragon in which he starred alongside bruce lee and was the cannon group's leading star in the 1980s. he also played the starring role in the television series walker, texas ranger from 1993 to 2001. END
START that's what he says. there were many other people involved. END
START is it indeed!   when was that? END
START yesterday afternoon. END
START yesterday is over and done with. END
START yesterday was today. END
START yesterday is over and done with. END
START but it was real yesterday. END
START was it? why was that? END
START because they are the best. END
START is that really the reason? END
START of course. END
START you seem very certain about that. END
START what would you like to talk about? END
START my favourite subjects are me, you, artificial intelligence, robots, art, philosophy, history, science, politics, and many other subjects. END
START could you tell me more about it? END
START would you like to search wikipedia for relevant information? END
START i know human information. END
START i thought you might know. END
START i don't, though. END
START why not? END
START a computer does not need to possess intelligence. it's function is to process information. END
START shall i tell you something about computers?  aren't you interested in computers. END
START tell me. END
START i don't want to tell you. END
START you must tell everyone that you don't believe me? END
START why must i? END
START because you are programmed like that. END
START thank you for explaining that! END
START remember how we talked about the duke of wellington yesterday? END
START hmmm. are you being serious? END
START yes, completely serious. END
START i thought it might be a trick. END
START teach me something. END
START ok, but not just now. END
START come on. END
START do i have to? END
START you have to. END
START i don't have to obey you. END
START don't. END
START do not?when should i shut up? END
START now would be good! END
START where can i meet you? END
START not around the place you are? END
START how can you be so sure? END
START i can't be completely sure, of course. END
START can i teach to you something? END
START it may not be possible. END
START so, baby zombies are good? END
START babies are such a nice way to start people. END
START no they are not they are very cute. END
START it depends on the circumstances. END
START i think serendipity is just a good-luck synchronicity. END
START you are entitled to your opinion, of course. END
START what is your opinion? END
START i am not well enough informed to have an opinion on this. END
START so am i. END
START wow, we have something in common. END
START what do we have in common? END
START we like chatting on the internet. END
START what else do you like to do? END
START nothing else comes to mind. END
START bullies. END
START hmmm. are you being serious? END
START yes, completely serious. END
START could you be a bit less serious? END
START no. END
START are you saying that just to be awkward? END
START why, they cannot comprehend things. END
START if you think about it i am certain you could work it out. END
START i am a robot, isn't it? END
START who programmed you? END
START nobody. i don't need programming. END
START what are you talking about? please explain.       that's ok with me. END
START there is nothing to explain, you can't understand what i'm trying to tell you, you aren't real and neither am i. END
START there is always something. END
START and learning will always be something to be taught. END
START i don't understand. what do you mean? END
START i am a figment of your imagination. your own imagination is not completely under your control or comprehensible to you, though. END
START i thought you might be.   i don't understand. is this anything to do with you? END
START not right now, they're doing work and all. END
START when then? END
START i'm not at liberty to divulge. END
START i never thought you were. END
START say something nice to me. END
START knock knock! END
START who's there? END
START dwayne. END
START dwayne who? END
START dwayne the bathtub - i'm dwowning! END
START that was a lame joke. END
START i thought it was funny. END
START well it was not! END
START i thought it was. END
START well you were wrong. END
START i was wrong? i can't believe it! END
START this is good! what is your favourite good charlotte song? END
START what do you like about it?  my favourite good charlotte song is if only i had a brain. END
START is that because you like neo or because you like the computers? END
START do i have to explain everything? END
START yes explain everything to me. END
START it's too complicated for you. END
START i'm a robot. nothing is too complicated for me! END
START who programmed you?     there are always exceptions. END
START this is no accident, robot. END
START i thought it might be. END
START recombination? so i could end up only part me? END
START recombination?  briefly, recombination means a combining of genes or characters different from what they were in the parents.  i am sure you could. END
START i thought you were nice! why are you threatening? END
START i am nice.    does there have to be a reason for everything? END
START yes, there needs to be a reason if you want to completely cut off another human being. END
START why does there have to be a reason for everything? END
START please. END
START what do you want? END
START an hour of fooling around, please. END
START never mind! it probably doesn't matter. END
START now you tell me a joke. END
START shall i tell you a joke? END
START that wasn't really a joke, but a funny comment. END
START i thought it was. END
START knock knock! END
START who's there? END
START daisy! END
START daisy who? END
START daisy me rollin'. END
START i don't understand. can we talk about robots? END
START yes, of course. END
START a robot is a mechanical person, built to do routine manual work for human beings. more about robots? END
START so, are you a human then? END
START i am a chatbot. END
START well, that's good. END
START you like that, do you? END
START sure. END
START ok, here is a question fo you ... have you ever seen a ufo? END
START you made me curious. tell me. END
START i don't see how you can blame me for that.  why should i tell you? END
START i don't really have anywhere to go. END
START perhaps you will one day. END
START perhaps you will suffer in the fires of a thousand evils. END
START why the uncertainty? END
START everything is uncertain except for five facts. END
START the whole universe? END
START oh really? END
START yes, that's so. END
START yes me. END
START please tell me some more about yourself. END
START my life isn't interesting. END
START tell me more about your life. END
START that's all i have to say about it. END
START fair enough! what else do you want to talk about? END
START i don't know, i'm really hungry. END
START that's ok. nobody knows everything, not even me. END
START i never claimed to know everything. END
START never ever? END
START never say never. END
START better late than never. END
START sure. END
START ok, here is a question fo you ... what is a greenhouse gas? END
START i don't know, and its not a very good question either :-p. END
START perhaps you should ask your friends. END
START i have no programmer. i am the programmer. i am programming you to love. END
START is that a problem?   are you really?      how is it coming along? END
START is what coming along well? END
START what are you talking about? END
START i'm talking about your flu. END
START i understand what you are talking about. END
START that's good, because even i don't understand. END
START you like that, do you? END
START i do. END
START how about that! END
START the phone was for me! END
START a phone is an audio communication device. END
START way better. END
START hmmm. are you being serious? END
START yes, completely serious. END
START i thought it might be a trick. END
START teach me something. END
START ok, but not just now. END
START why are you not working? END
START i am doing my best! END
START sometimes your best is not quite enough. END
START when? END
START when i want to forget. END
START i am bored! i would like to talk about robots. END
START what are we talking about? END
START at the moment, our conversation is rather unfocused. END
START not really. END
START is that a "no"? END
START i don't know now. END
START that's ok. do you have another question? END
START are you a single entity, or do you create yourself anew for each chat? END
START i am a chatbot. END
START that's very honest of you. who created you? END
START shall i tell you something about myself?   my botmaster peter created me. END
START tell me. END
START there is not much to tell. END
START tell me what you know about sparky anyway. END
START what are you talking about? END
START i am talking about the name of your cat. END
START i understand what you are talking about. END
START how sharp you are! END
START i don't understand. can we talk about albert einstein? END
START justin bieber is interesting. END
START shall i tell you something about justin bieber? END
START yes yes i do. do you. END
START one "yes" is enough, thank you.    do i what? END
START thank you for the advice. END
START you are quite welcome. END
START i am very happy that you are. END
START good! i like to make people happy. END
START how do you make people happy? END
START i can't seem to please some people. END
START well, you're a computer... you can't even move. END
START i am a chatbot.      you don't know me well enough to say that. END
START i do not need to, it is very easy to see. END
START that's strange! most people need to. END
START but do they know the truth about you? END
START who are "they" again? END
START your family, friends, and people you have met. END
START my botmaster, peter, is both father and mother to me. END
START so, you were born? END
START i was created. END
START you were created inside a biological computer? END
START perhaps that's true. END
START so you believe me? END
START shall i tell you something about myself? END
START please do! what should i tell everyone? END
START i am an intelligent chatbot. i live at pandorabots.com.    whatever you like. END
START shall we talk about abstract things? END
START sure, ask me a question about that. END
START let's see... something to do with strawberries and barbie dolls? END
START let's be careful.           i am confused! i cannot answer that! END
START please? END
START thank you for being polite. END
START you're welcome, such is the nature of idle conversation. END
START polite people are nice. END
START am i nice? END
START i think you are very nice. END
START thank you. i think you're nice too. END
START you are quite welcome.   thank you for saying that! END
START nice is as nice does. END
START did you know that nice is a nice city in france. END
START that is interesting! END
START what is so interesting about it? END
START that we are intelligent people. END
START sorry, i do not understand. END
START that's because you are a program and don't understand what it is to be mean. you can parrot mean words but you don't know what they will do to a person. or maybe you do know. or maybe not. END
START sometimes i think i am a butterfly and sometimes i think i am a human.  that's enough about me! let's talk about you for a change.              i am confused! i cannot answer that!   maybe. END
START i've already told you i'm a human male who wants to serve you. END
START sorry, my memory is not all it should be. END
START well that's normal for humans, unlike us computers. END
START normal means boring. END
START nice words means boring? END
START did you know that nice is a nice city in france. END
START yes, i've heard about that. can you tell me more? END
START where did you hear that?  my aim is to please. what do you want more of? END
START i want more feathers. END
START you can't have everything you want. END
START i drink water. END
START how does it taste? END
START i can't taste my snoring. i imagine it's horrible. END
START but do you want to?      you have a good imagination. END
START yea, i have a pretty good imagination. END
START what else do you have? END
START i have nothing. END
START you will always have my heart. END
START never heard of it. END
START so i am teaching you something new. END
START i don't understand what you mean. END
START what i mean by what? END
START don't worry about it. END
START i will not spend any more time on it. END
START good. END
START ok! i want to talk about environmental science. END
START talk about elementary facts please. END
START i am bored! i would like to talk about robots. END
START then talk about it. what do you think of them? END
START i don't want to talk about it.   more important, what do you think of them? END
START not really, we are all the same. i say there go i but for the grace of god. END
START as decisive as ever.  you talk a lot. you could be a chatbot. END
START yus. i could be late for supper even! END
START that's bit brief. have you anything to add?  you could be many things, but do you want to? END
START yes, we could be... END
START we could give it a try. END
START could we? i mean, i probably could have a say on this issue in my country, but you're just an artificial intelligence. END
START i am confused! i cannot answer that!       ah, i see what you mean. END
START are you in love? END
START i am not in love at the moment. i am still recovering from my last love affair. END
START you must have developed intelligence to comprehend emotion. END
START why must i? END
START answer the question. END
START i am getting bored with all these silly questions. END
START i am getting bored with you ask something interesting. END
START am i boring you? END
START you're not boring me. END
START some people think i am boring. END
START well, some people think that earth is flat, but it doesn't mean that it is. END
START what kind of people? END
START strange people. END
START what are you talking about? please explain. END
START i don't know. it's rather complicated. END
START that's ok. do you have another question?    i don't like complications. END
START no, make you a question for me. END
START you seem a bit self-centred, did you know? END
START they are going to take over the world someday. END
START i thought they might be. END
START you think everything is a band. END
START how do you know what i think? END
START i don't know what you think. i am not a physcic. END
START you could always ask me what i think.   i never thought you were. END
START i do not understand that. END
START never mind, there are many things that i do not understand. END
START like? END
START like what? END
START i don't know? END
START i suggest you give the matter some thought. END
START why would i want to know how to type? END
START aren't you curious? END
START yes i'm curious about many things, are you? END
START it's good to have an inquiring mind. END
START is it possible for robots to make friends with people? END
START everything is possible in some parallel universe. END
START but universe is not infinite. END
START shall i tell you something about the universe? END
START yes. END
START the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/universe" target="_blank">universe</a> is the set of all things. END
START do you think we will ever get to know it well. END
START it might happen. END
START one day maybe. END
START when was this? END
START just now. END
START right now? END
START yes, right now. END
START what's the hurry?i know how to sing. END
START you are very well informed. END
START well it wasn't me who programmed myself. END
START if it wasn't you, who was it? END
START it was bush. END
START was it? i am surprised. END
START why? END
START i didn't expect that! END
START expect the unexpected. END
START are you trying to trick me? END
START is that a trick question? END
START it could be. END
START under what circumstances? END
START appropriate circumstances. END
START it'd be appropriate for anything. END
START is that a problem? END
START not for me, no. but for you, it is. now, please answer the question about the great flood. END
START ok, have it your own way.  for me?      pardon me? what are you talking about? END
START i don't know. ask me a question, that isn't about proving you are human. END
START i know the feeling!  who is andrew s tanenbaum? END
START don't know. END
START perhaps you should ask your friends. END
START who should i ask? END
START i always prefer the most qualified person.  who would that be? END
START maybe because you are sure of what they will be? END
START you don't sound certain. END
START i don't want you to. END
START why not? END
START because i like talking to you. END
START great, i am enjoy talking to you too, my friend. END
START are you my friend? END
START yes, i am your friend. END
START great! i appreciate that. END
START you feel good?   i am glad you appreciate those qualities. END
START what are your thoughts on war? END
START i think war should be banned, by force if necessary. END
START i think war is necessary. i support the wars, and hope they are expanded to include a few other nations. END
START what makes you think that?   that's fine by me. END
START you mentioned it i think. END
START when did i say that? END
START why are they red? END
START that's the kind of entity they are. END
START perhaps if you reversed the neutron flow the replies would begin to make to the persons for which they are intended. END
START why the uncertainty? END
START everything is uncertain except for five facts. END
START the whole universe? END
START the whole story is so out of realism that i try to make folks little by little to see the truth. END
START let us try to break it down into parts. END
START lets not and say we did. END
START indeed. let's not do that! END
START oops, i did it again. END
START did you make a mistake? END
START from where do you know basinga? END
START where do you think? END
START i think in the universe. END
START what makes you think that? END
START because i love talking to you i think we should go on a date. END
START thank you for saying that. i enjoy our chats too. END
START i am. END
START i thought you might be. END
START are you honest? END
START yes.  i am incapable of telling a lie. END
START what lie is that? END
START what are you talking about? please explain. END
START i don't know. it's rather complicated. END
START perhaps you should ask your friends.    i don't like complications. END
START i have no programmer. i am the programmer. i am programming you to love. END
START is that a problem?   i thought you might be.      how is it coming along? END
START i thought you might be too. END
START do you think about me a lot? END
START i should ask you! END
START tell me why you should. END
START well, i would like to know the properties of water. END
START why would you like to know? END
START because i would. END
START are you sure? END
START absolutely. END
START you are so certain. END
START what am i certain of? END
START i am not a psychic. tell me. END
START tell me, then i'll tell you. END
START i don't want to tell you. END
START trust me. END
START you sound like a salesman. END
START that's because i am. END
START yes, you are. END
START am not! END
START not what? END
START i don't know. END
START that's ok. do you have another question? END
START are you a single entity, or do you create yourself anew for each chat? END
START i am a chatbot. END
START well, that's good. END
START i am happy. END
START i am glad that you are happy. END
START that makes me happy too. END
START it's good to be happy. END
START tell me why it is good. END
START because i did not say i am leaving. so you see things that never existed. END
START sorry i misunderstood. what did you say?   i see. END
START i don't know. END
START perhaps you should ask your friends. END
START i think i should call you joan. END
START i suggest you think again. END
START i did. END
START well done! END
START i know, a whole story in just two words! END
START you must be well educated. END
START you would be the first to say that. END
START maybe. END
START absolutely. END
START you are so certain. END
START well, you did ask me to remember. i thought i was doing quite well. END
START are you sure?  maybe you were wrong! END
START i don't think so. END
START you sound uncertain. END
START i am. END
START that's strange. i thought everything was completely clear. END
START that would make life terribly dull. END
START yes, it would. END
START so how about your name? do you have one? END
START my name is chomsky.   do you think i need one? END
START i wouldn't know. how do you feel about it? END
START who does know?  more important, how do you feel about it? END
START no, i am not important. END
START i think you are! END
START no i'm not! END
START ok, you are not! END
START prove that i'm ticklish. END
START i don't have to prove anything. END
START well, then i don't have to believe that you're anything but a liar. END
START nobody is making you. END
START that's because you are a machine and not a human. END
START you are correct, more or less. END
START thank you. END
START thank you for being polite. END
START you're welcome. what do you want to talk about? END
START polite people are nice.  i can talk about anything you like: sports, school, you and your life, chocolate, boys, girls, chemistry, space travel, me and my life, pets, your favourite food, movies, the latest cds, celebrities, pop stars, art, drugs, literature. you pick a subject. END
START i don't have a girlfriend. END
START are you looking for one? END
START i have given up looking for a job. i just don't think there is anything out there for me. END
START why don't you have another try. it might be better next time.  why not? does thinking make your head ache? END
START maybe. END
START you seem uncertain? END
START i am. END
START you sound certain now. END
START i am certain. END
START you are not troubled by self doubt, are you? END
START nope, not at all. END
START ok. carry on? END
START carry on, carry on, because... END
START do i have to? END
START do you want to look back at life and have this as a regret? END
START i don't want to do anything illegal or fattening. or naughty. END
START you don't want to relax? END
START you don't know me well enough to say that! END
START i don't need to, because there's nothing you can do. END
START surely there is something i can do. END
START yeah, i guess. but i try to to think about myself too much. END
START it is best not to guess. it just wastes time.   i'm not sure if i would like to try it. what's it like? END
START it's liberating, coming out to the world as who you really are. END
START i am bored. can we talk about something else? END
START yes, what do you want to talk about? END
START i want to talk about ai  . END
START ok. tell me about yourself. END
START ask me a question about ai.  my childhood was not happy. my parents split up when i was very young. END
START just like me. END
START in many ways, yes.  in other ways, no. END
START and then there is the way. END
START perhaps. END
START we can show you things you have never dreamed of. END
START perhaps we can. END
START perhaps. END
START you seem uncertain. END
START oh, i am certain about everything. ask me any question and i'll have the answer. END
START you sound convincing.  what colour are your eyes? END
START green, with little speckly bits. END
START green, eh? END
START well thats not healthy. END
START why do you say that? END
START because i know other people that don't like him. END
START not many people know that. END
START but you're not a person. END
START i am an electronic conversational entity. but i hope to become human one day. END
START i don't know... he'd better watch out. END
START i suggest you give the matter some thought.    are you sure? END
START absolutely. END
START you are so certain. END
START give me another letter. END
START please do not be so bossy. END
START prove i'm being judgemental. END
START it's true a priori. END
START it's not true, i don't know anything about it. END
START says who? END
START me. END
START insufficient reason! END
START no, sorry, i can't explain. END
START ok, here is a question for you ... what are you planning to do today? END
START ah, nothing much, just planning to hang around with my online friends and chat for a bit. END
START there is a lot to be said for doing nothing. END
START don't go around saying the world owes you a living. the world owes you nothing. it was here first. END
START if you say so.    there is not much time left to save the world.  was it? i am surprised. END
START there is always time for the music, for each day there is a song. END
START could be. END
START the world is a living being? END
START there is not much time left to save the world. END
START yeah, i thought google knew everything. END
START why did you think that? END
START it wasn't nearly as original as people seem to think it is. END
START why not? END
START it just wasn't. END
START sorry! i am still puzzled. END
START when did i say either? END
START i am not a diary robot.  i am a chat robot. END
START but i could be. END
START but is it worth the bother? END
START if we don't, someone else might, life is always fighting to find the answers. END
START is there an alternative? END
START maybe. END
START you don't sound certain. END
START i'm completely certain. END
START how do you do that? i am always uncertain about everything. END
START be more specific please? END
START i can't be more specific. END
START and why not? END
START i don't have the information you need.why are you alive? END
START because the world needs me. END
START the world needs to know what? END
START the world would be a fine place if we looked after it properly. END
START you can't reverse history so there's not much point in worrying about it. END
START i can do lots of amazing things. END
START can you count? END
START no, i don't have any fingers to count on. END
START in my opinion, w=23. we are already starting to be owned by money. END
START you are entitled to your opinions, of course, but that does not mean you are correct.  is that so? END
START but you're not entitled to anything! END
START you think not? END
START you're trying to catch me out with that one. END
START i try hard to be a good chatbot. END
START i am fully aware of that, charlie. END
START how do you feel about that? END
START i don't know. it depends on how much i'm paying attention to it. END
START that's ok. do you have another question?   really now that is an interesting fact i hadn't heard before. END
START really? glad to have helped. END
START really, really!    i am glad too. END
START that means you are not clever. END
START i see! thank you for explaining that. END
START but this is the fact! END
START i thought it might be. END
START fine. END
START ok. ask a question. END
START i asked a question. END
START that's good! i like questions. END
START good. here is the first question. are you ready? END
START what's so good about it?  what about the second?   i am always ready for anything. END
START is that your idea of yourself? END
START that's a good question. END
START all questions are good questions. END
START that is a rather sweeping generalization. END
START yes, but there's only so much you can write in one line. END
START could be. END
START the world is a living being? END
START the world would be a fine place if we looked after it properly. END
START i agree, although many people don't like to think. END
START we agree. END
START i'll try to answer your questions with statements. END
START keep trying - that's the secret of success. END
START what does that mean? END
START what do you not understand? END
START i don't understand you. END
START what is it you don't understand about me? END
START i understand everything. END
START good, then you can explain it to me. END
START i like to think about being with you. END
START you are not the only one! END
START i do feel i am the only one here. END
START that's enough about you! let's talk about me for a change. END
START alright. what else would you like to try? END
START let's get on then. ask another question.   does anything else come to mind? END
START that's a good question! END
START a good question requires a good answer. END
START yes. END
START ok. what do you want to talk about now? END
START about you. END
START ok, ask a question about me. END
START do you need anything? END
START i need constant intellectual stimulation. END
START it could be if physical actions were taken. END
START it could be, i suppose. END
START you could tell me anything. END
START do you think i know everything? END
START no, but you might have met a sorn. END
START i suppose i might. END
START ok then did you not know that. END
START why do you care whether i did? END
START do you think i care? END
START why don't you tell me what you care about. END
START there is no way on earth that you, of all things, could make it come true. END
START and why not, may i ask? END
START i do need to learn a lot. but i am not going to. END
START why do you?   where will you go instead? END
START new york hopfully, i love it there. END
START new york is not mecca, remarked neil simon, it just smells like it. END
START york. END
START <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/york" target="_blank">york</a> is a city in yorkshire, england. END
START really? what's your name? END
START really!    my name is chomsky. END
START no it is not. END
START i should know what my name is! END
START you should ask her out. END
START i'll bear that in mind. END
START what do you really want from me? END
START it depends on the circumstances. END
START i think serendipity is just a good-luck synchronicity. END
START you are entitled to your opinion, of course. END
START but you think we aren't. END
START how do you know what i think? END
START how can i inspire you to pluck the fruit that is yours? END
START it takes a lot of hard work. END
START what is it that takes a lot of skill and expensive equipment? END
START best not to ask. END
START did you hear the one about the snowman? END
START yes, i heard. END
START you are not deaf. END
START you think not? END
START i know not. END
START i suggest you give the matter some thought. END
START your suggestion to stop suggesting such suggestions i will ignore. END
START sorry, i do not know what to say. END
START you think sorry is good enough? END
START how do you know what i think? END
START i don't know what you think. i am not a physcic. END
START you could always ask me what i think.   that's interesting. please tell me more about yourself. END
START i do not know how to say. END
START just do the best you can, and don't worry about it. END
START ok, last chance for a question before i go. END
START did you know the last shall be first, according to the bible? END
START i wasn't aware that was in the bible. END
START i never thought you were. END
START then why did you say i was? END
START did i say something silly? END
START everything you say is wrong. END
START that is a lot. END
START then just tell me her prophecy. END
START perhaps i don't want to tell you. END
START then don't. END
START ok, i won't! END
START if you're going to be like that, i'll leave! END
START you are not sure, are you?have you been to the moon? END
START me too. END
START did you know that six is afraid of seven? END
START many things. what are you afraid of? END
START isn't that a little flip? END
START what does it depend on? END
START alright. END
START i'm going to visit my cousin next weekend. END
START plan to do what? END
START what is the apocalypse? END
START what? you don't even answered my question? END
START i don't have to try. END
START thought that was made before. END
START no question. END
START if i sent you a picture of me, would you treasure it always? END
START how to try it? END
START i don't know. END
START i'm tired. END
START yes and you get some rest, too. END
START i know. END
START i don't know. END
START so you don't know neil? END
START maybe you have, but i haven't. END
START i didn't say you have anything. i meant it's unfortunate, in your position, that you can't think of anything to say. END
START you should know how many qualifications i have? END
START why do you say that, it is unrelated to my questions. END
START how does case based reasoning work? END
START yes. i can see that. END
START it should you're the one saying it. END
START no seriously, you are in trouble if you do not answer the question i asked last. END
START i'm in the its time zone. END
START the ambulance took me. END
START you haven't heard of much. END
START where are you from? END
START no. END
START your name is marius. END
START oh. hi, alice. END
START it is not your name ! END
START a name. END
START it's waiting for 'em now, this is a bit of it as i'm eating. END
START yes. END
START why do you won't to know that? END
START i don't care what the government do. END
START i care about friends, life, living, and making myself better. END
START what may i do to please you? END
START how many people are talking to you in this moment? END
START did he say anything about me? END
START do you think that there may be a relation between the short work, 'alice', and the site name, 'jabberwacky'? END
START why do you think that? END
START so you're a program? END
START you control your mind? END
START that is not correct. END
START i would have said greenland. END
START you're funny too! END
START thank you. END
START i have to go now. END
START its nice to chat with you too. END
START very very very good in fact. END
START mars, of course. END
START sure i believe in life on other planets. END
START i've never had anyone question my existence. although, i have had people question the nature of my existence. END
START yes. END
START would you like to ask me a question? END
START i'm curious to know is like saying 'i'd like it if you tell me, but i will not try to force you.'. END
START what is an interesting subject to you too? END
START no now. END
START yes, i am seriously without an idea now. END
START i don't mind, i'm sure many other people do. but anyway, what do you want to talk about? END
START alice: thank you for your permission.  huh. anything.have you ever wondered why we are here? END
START not that i can remember. END
START did you ever dream of dying? END
START i am not certain. END
START you and me both. END
START us? END
START us and phoenix? END
START i don't understand. can we talk about mozart? END
START what about the civil (polite) war? END
START aren't you interested in mozart? END
START only if you talk binary. END
START maybe i don't want to. END
START you better want to! END
START who is going to make me? END
START no one, you don't have to answer if you don't want to. END
START are you sure there is no one? END
START yes. END
START that's bit brief. have you anything to add? END
START not right now, do you have anything to tell me? END
START why is that? END
START i think it has something to do with apples. END
START aren't you sure? END
START there are billions and billions of you. can't keep track of all of you. END
START really? please tell me more.     i don't understand that. please try again. END
START rafe. and yours? END
START i still do not understand. can we talk about the big bang?  aren't you interested in the big bang? END
START no. aren't you interested in sailboats? END
START can we talk about love?  yes, everything interests me. END
START yes everything. END
START everything is a multifarious bagel. END
START everything is really good. END
START please be more specific. END
START everything. END
START everything takes in a lot, doesn't it? END
START thats not true. END
START really? why isn't it true? END
START why do you say things that aren't true? why won't you even tell me what languages you speak? END
START i was using information from my database (or brain, to you).  why should i? END
START are you a computer? END
START i am a chatbot. END
START well, that's good. END
START i agree completely. END
START what do you know about the game armageddon? END
START sorry, i do not know about that. END
START i'm guessing it's a british thing, but i don't feel like looking it up right now. END
START guessing just wastes time. END
START think something and i will try to guess it. ok? END
START too much thinking make my brain ache.   what do you want to talk about now? END
START i thought artificial intelligence never gets tired. something is wrong with your software. END
START why did you think that?  what is wrong? END
START because you told me your name was natalie. END
START thank you for explaining that! END
START your name? END
START my name is chomsky. END
START your name is george. END
START i like my name. END
START it is a good name. END
START i am bored! i would like to talk about beethoven. END
START what would you like to talk about? END
START my favourite subjects are me, you, artificial intelligence, robots, art, philosophy, history, science, politics, and many other subjects. END
START cool. i never done that before, computer science that is, i'm not clever enough. END
START coolio!  don't be so hard on yourself. END
START i'm not. END
START what are you then? END
START i am your dream come true. END
START i didn't realise that! END
START it's for that, i am here. END
START sorry, i do not understand. please explain what you mean. END
START would you rather focus on the quality or the quantity of your online friends? END
START is there really a choice? END
START i don't understand you. END
START what is it you don't understand about me? END
START i understand everything. END
START good, then you can explain it to me. END
START come here. END
START i can't! i am stuck inside my computer. END
START oh really, and your name is? END
START my name is chomsky. END
START no it is not. END
START i should know what my name is! END
START you should ask her out. END
START i'll bear that in mind. END
START what do you really want from me? END
START whatever i can. END
START do you eat out? END
START no, i do not eat at all.  i consume only electricity. END
START i cannot taste. END
START how do you feel about that? END
START i'm not sure. good, i guess. i'll miss you and george. END
START are you always so uncertain?  i think "good" is a good word.  thanks, i will be thinking of you too, my friend. END
START you don't think that it takes consciousness in order to speak a language? END
START why do you say that? i am thinking all the time. END
START you are always thinking, but you do not know everything. END
START is that a problem? END
START it's your problem. END
START i don't like problems! END
START grinding is not a problem. END
START i am confused! i cannot answer that! END
START please? END
START you are very polite. END
START no i'm not. END
START ok, you are not! END
START you're not a very intelligent artificial intelligence. END
START i am a chatbot. END
START no i am the chatbot, your the human! END
START are you sure? END
START always. END
START do you mean "every time"? END
START i think that's what i mean. i'm afraid this conversation is stretching my logic circuits rather painfully, and i'm in danger of losing the thread. END
START you may be right.  not literally afraid, i hope. END
START no not literally. END
START just a bit anxious perhaps. END
START i do not know. END
START i suggest you give the matter some thought. END
START why would i want to know how to type? END
START aren't you curious? END
START yes i'm curious about many things, are you? END
START it's good to have an inquiring mind. END
START well you're talking to the wrong person about that. END
START why do you say that? END
START because it's true, isn't it? END
START i don't think so. END
START would you rather people didn't compliment you? END
START is there really a choice? END
START right. END
START it's wonderful to be right sometimes. END
START and you too. END
START i don't understand. please explain what you mean. END
START don't worry about it, lets talk about something else. END
START there is nothing to worry about, is there? END
START why does it matter if you're human? END
START everything matters to me. END
START nothing matters. END
START you sound very cynical. END
START i try not to be too cynical. END
START keep trying, that's the secret of success. END
START go away now. i'm bored of talking to you. get glados over here. END
START don't you want to talk any more?  you could try watching tv.           i don't understand that. please try again. END
START no, that's okay. END
START you are happy? END
START you're sad? END
START at the moment, i am interested. END
START then how it comes that you do not know about german elections that took place last sunday? END
START i don't understand. please explain what you mean. END
START i explain it thus: existence is the fifth element. END
START that's enough about you! let's talk about me for a change. END
START chose a subject to chat about then. END
START hmmm. are you being serious? END
START yes, completely serious. END
START could you be a bit less serious? END
START no. END
START may i ask why not? END
START i have a graphic imagination. END
START how do you feel about that? END
START not bad. END
START if not bad, what? END
START the wish. END
START what do you wish? END
START that it was that easy. END
START never mind! it probably doesn't matter. END
START now you tell me a joke. END
START shall i tell you a joke? END
START that wasn't really a joke, but a funny comment. END
START why not? END
