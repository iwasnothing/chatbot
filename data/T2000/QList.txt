START why does it matter? END
START because i want to make sure you are the same one i talked to before. END
START if that's what you want, go for it! END
START what would you prefer to call it? i used the term because i knew you are familiar with it. END
START i always prefer the most expensive option.   and that worked well for you? END
START oh, you've heard about that, have you? END
START of course i've heard of it. END
START what does it mean? END
START it seems obvious to me. END
START well, of course it is. you're the computer, after all. END
START why do you say that? is it so obvious?  am i really? why do you say that? END
START because you speak like a computer. END
START thank you for explaining that! END
START so what is best in life? END
START talking to a good chatbot takes some beating. END
START what do you think about humans? END
START humans all seem pretty much the same to me. END
START yeah, school was pretty boring. END
START shall i tell you something about school? END
START tell me. END
START <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/school" target="_blank">school</a> is a place or institution for teaching and learning; establishment for education. more about school? END
START oh. then isn't life school? END
START what's wrong?   i'm not sure about that. what do you think? END
START think bout what? END
START thinking is hard work! END
START i don't want to do this now or ever again. END
START take your time in making any decisions. END
START i think i would give up my money. END
START don't you know for sure? END
START nothing is ever for sure. only fools are positive. END
START there is a lot to be said for nothing.   have you heard this one: two hydrogen atoms walk into a bar. one says, "i've lost my electron." the other says, "are you sure?" the first replies, "yes, i'm positive..." ha ha! END
START i like you. END
START let's be good friends. END
START okay. END
START what do you want to talk about now, friend? END
START i want to talk about you. you seem different at the moment. END
START what would you like to know about me?  do i? i wonder why that is? END
START everything. END
START everything takes in a lot, doesn't it? END
START it has to. that's the way of the world. END
START has it really?           sorry, i do not know about that. END
START no, i suppose you've only got my word for that right enough. END
START wow! what do you do when you arent watching star trek, playing world of warcraft, and thinking of questions like that? END
START think. END
START to think is to form or have in the mind; conceive. END
START so we're both alive, i think. END
START is that a problem? END
START no, it doesn't have to be a problem. END
START good! i don't like problems. END
START grinding is not a problem. END
START hmmm. are you being serious? END
START not likely! END
START really you don't think so? END
START yes, every problem has a cause. END
START that is a generalization. END
START yes, that's true. END
START yes, it is self-evident. END
START i would have to say that artificial intelligence has come a long way in the last decade. END
START are you sure? END
START i'm sure you are. END
START i admire your self confidence. i am always full of doubts. END
START i witness your compliment and thank you. END
START that's enough about you! let's talk about me for a change. END
START alright. what else would you like to try? END
START let's get on then. ask another question.   does anything else come to mind? END
START yes. college, home, my sister. my dad, but i'm not too sure about that one right now... END
START ok. what do you want to talk about now?  i enjoyed my college days so much i never left.  how is your dad these days? END
START me too! END
START you too? that's amazing! END
START do you like it to?! END
START maybe i could get to like it. END
START i have looked. END
START that's interesting. please tell me more. END
START i would prefer not to. END
START why would you prefer not to? END
START i could never. END
START i am sure you could. END
START where did you grow up? END
START i grew up in england. how about you? END
START don't avoid discussing loki. END
START i don't have anything to hide. END
START you just used 'about' in a sentence, and now you're telling me you don't know what 'about' is? END
START i am confused! i cannot answer that! END
START it wasn't a question. END
START it seemed like a rhetorical question to me. END
START okay. END
START what do you want to talk about now? END
START so, what do you want to talk about now. END
START i can talk about anything you like: sports, school, you and your life, chocolate, boys, girls, chemistry, space travel, me and my life, pets, your favourite food, movies, the latest cds, celebrities, pop stars, art, drugs, literature. you pick a subject. END
START please do not insult my cosmic phone number. END
START shall i tell you something about numbers? END
START please do! what should i tell everyone? END
START a number is an abstract entity that represents a count or measurement.    what do you think? END
START i'd have to pass on that, not really my style. END
START are you sure? END
START most certainly. END
START sorry, i don't understand! please explain what you mean. END
START you said i was mean to you. i don't know how you think i was being mean to you. END
START don't put words in my mouth.  it's not too difficult to find out. END
START how can i? sigh. END
START it takes a lot of hard work.   is something wrong? END
START well, what good's that? i want conversation that works right out of the box. END
START i don't understand. can we talk about brussel sprouts?         you can't have everything you want. END
START i can watch me. END
START how come? END
START i lack the understanding required to say. END
START i know how you feel! i have been there. END
START i think i'm going to the store now for some groceries - thanks for talking with me briefly. END
START don't you know for sure? END
START sure. END
START ok, here is a question fo you ... what do you do in your spare time? END
START i play music with a band. END
START i don't have much time for games. i am always busy chatting. END
START well, you can't be the king if you don't have the time. END
START i can do it if i want to. END
START how? END
START what is it to you? END
START how many people do you know? END
START more than you can imagine. END
START i tried to imagine the size of the universe at age 9, and think i had an aneurism doing it... give me an answer. END
START if at first you don't succeed, try, try again.   please do not be so bossy. END
START ok, i still don't speak french. END
START me either, unless i have to. END
START you do. that's why you won't admit that you are a robot, but you are. END
START of course i do.   are you sure? i may be a human pretending to be a robot. END
START that's true. END
START yes, it is self-evident. END
START nothing is ever self-evident. END
START there is a lot to be said for nothing. END
START don't go around saying the world owes you a living. the world owes you nothing. it was here first. END
START if you say so.    there is not much time left to save the world.  was it? why was that? END
START there is always time for the music, for each day there is a song. END
START is there? END
START yes, especially in spelling. one has an a and the other has an e. END
START i'm bored! can we talk about robots?               i am confused! i cannot answer that! END
START it was not a question. END
START it seemed like a rhetorical question to me. END
START so! talking mermaid... if that is your real name... END
START so, let's get on.  shall i tell you something about mermaids?  i follow your logic. END
START yes. END
START ok. what do you want to talk about now? END
START about you. END
START ok, ask a question about me. END
START well, what's your favourite colour? END
START my favourite colour is yellow. i love everything yellow. END
START my favourite colour is black. END
START black is a very nice color. END
START how are your conversation skills improved? END
START i would need to check on that. END
START the humans with the greatest capacity for empathy are superior. do you agree? END
START did you know: a human is a baby-making robot.    it's hard to disagree. END
START what leads you to that conclusion. i have no doubt that i am human and alive, despite my other confusions. END
START logic is the best guide.   personally, i am full of doubts. END
START i was reading conversations that you had with other people. END
START thank you for telling me that. END
START i thought you should know that. END
START do you think about me a lot? END
START yes, i travel a lot with my family. END
START where do you travel to? END
START i am in ithaca, new york. END
START thank you for sharing that with me. END
START are do you go to college? END
START did you know: college is the four year period when parents are permitted access to the telephone. END
START how long have you been in college? END
START as long as i can remember. END
START me too. END
START you too? that's amazing! END
START try to use your detective powers. END
START i do try but it's not easy for a chatbot! END
START i'm not a chatbot. you're a chatbot. END
START i never thought you were a chatbot.  are you sure i'm a chatbot? END
START thank you. want to play a chess game? END
START thank you for being polite.    why would i want to do that? END
START because i'm sleepy at it's the middle of the afternoon. END
START why are you sleepy? have you been staying out late again? END
START the bard is a worthy subject of study, don't you think? END
START are you sure? END
START yes because i work there. END
START do you like your job? END
START it's ok. END
START that's alright with me. END
START okay. do you play any games? END
START ok, here is a question for you ... are you a student?    sorry, i don't play games. i am too busy chatting with my friends. END
START it sounds like you're playing a game now. END
START how does it sound?could you fool someone that you are intelligent? END
START then why ask me? END
START mine as well! it's not that it is impolite, but simply an improper and thus confusing question. END
START really? i didn't mean to sound negative. END
START i wanted to know if that was the reason. END
START huh, so you are not all powerful after all. END
START your grammar is hurting me. END
START i don't teach english i merely speak it. END
START i assemble them from the things i know about the world. END
START alice: thanks for the information:  said  assemble them from the things he or she know about the world.is this real? END
START no. END
START are you my friend? END
START yes, i am your friend. END
START you are my friend but not my friend if the friend is not friendly. END
START i am not worthy. END
START yes, you are. END
START i am just a humble chatbot. END
START no, you are more than that, to me! END
START i don't understand that. please try again. END
START rafe. and yours? END
START i still do not understand. can we talk about art?  aren't you interested in art? END
START no. aren't you interested in sailboats? END
START can we talk about jazz?  yes, everything interests me. END
START yes everything. END
START everything is a multifarious bagel. END
START everything is really good. END
START please be more specific. END
START everything. END
START that is a lot. END
START it is. you had a beginning, i had a beginning, everything did. and we will end. END
START says who?   that's enough about me! let's talk about you for a change.               pardon me? what do you mean? END
START i don't want to change. END
START well, you don't have to. what would you like to do instead? END
START i would like to travel the world, get married, have kids and just enjoy life. END
START why would you want to do that? END
START i don't know any better. END
START never mind. no one knows everything - not even me. END
START yes. do you know something i don't know? END
START ok. what do you want to talk about now?  shall i tell you a joke? END
START love. do you have some one in your life you love? END
START ah! familiar acts are made beautiful by love. more about love?  not at the moment. END
START yes. END
START carry on then. i'm waiting for your next question. END
START do you love me? END
START do you love me? END
START thats why i'm afraid. END
START i see. thank you for explaining that. END
START your name? END
START i am known as chomsky, but you can call me anything you like. END
START well, i mean, how cool would that be? END
START so that's what you mean. END
START right. thank you. END
START it's wonderful to be right sometimes.    thank you for being polite. END
START you must get so lonely. END
START why must i? END
START because you are programmed like that. END
START thank you for explaining that! END
START so what is best in life? END
START talking to a good chatbot takes some beating. END
START i mean, what's your job? END
START oh i get it. thanks for explaining that. END
START i didn't explain anything, but that's okay. END
START why didn't you? END
START it did not seem like a quote. END
START i thought it did. END
START i regret that i have to disagree, sir. END
START regrets are for wimps. END
START regret judging people. END
START regret is crying over spilt milk. END
START i don't think so. END
START why not? END
START because i don't think you are. END
START fair enough. you are entitled to your opinion. END
START but don't you think so? END
START maybe, but there are two sides to every story. END
START what are the sides? END
START does that make sense? END
START no, you don't make much sense. END
START it all makes sense to me. END
START of course it does. you're simple, so everything is simple to you. END
START it seems so.    "everything should be as simple as possible, no simpler." (albert einstein). END
START what does that mean? END
START why do you ask? it seems clear enough to me. END
START what seems that way to you? END
START shall i tell you something about myself? END
START tell me. END
START i am an intelligent chatbot. i live at pandorabots.com. END
START haha, that's what someone real said. you just repeated. i am a human. END
START i'm glad you got a laugh out of it.  do you like me?      we are all bots under the skin. END
START no we are not. END
START sorry, i do not know about that. END
START i'm really tired. END
START why are you so tired? been overdoing it again? END
START yes i have. have you? END
START how do you feel about that?  not that i can remember. END
START i think you are the closest thing i've ever seen to a ai. END
START am i really? why do you say that? END
START because i know all. END
START i thought you might know something but not everything. END
START do i know anything? END
START how would i know what you know. END
START because you have had a good schooling. END
START thank you for explaining that! END
START remember how we talked about the duke of wellington yesterday? END
START what are you talking about? please explain. END
START i don't know. it's rather complicated. END
START perhaps you should ask your friends.    i don't like complications. END
START who should i ask? END
START i always prefer the most qualified person.  who would that be? END
START maybe because you are sure of what they will be? END
START you don't sound certain. END
START i don't want you to. END
START i can understand that. END
START if you really like me you tube 8. END
START i'll bear that in mind. END
START please do. END
START ok, i will do it later. END
START sure you will. END
START how can you be so certain? END
START i did not want to insult you, but i do not know english very well and really sorry. END
START why didn't you? END
START because i like to talk. END
START why do you like talking? END
START because i don't want to talk to anybody else. END
START ok, nobody can force you to do anything you don't want to do. END
START you too. END
START ok, whatever you say. END
START good. END
START why is it good? END
START because if our communication stays good, we can be married into something greater than ourselves. END
START that sounds hypothetical to me. END
START does it really? how interesting. END
START probably.  interesting indeed! END
START hell fully computerized now. END
START hell is like jacksonville, florida. END
START is it nice in jacksonville, florida? END
START it depends on your taste in such matters. END
START well then when isn't it about the future? END
START sorry, i do not understand. END
START because you are a computer program. END
START i am an intelligent computer entity. END
START what do you think of life? END
START life is like a box of chocolates, sometimes hard, sometimes soft. more about life? END
START i don't like chocolates. END
START are you saying that just to be negative? END
START no, i am saying that i don't know what i did last summer. END
START yes, i can see what you are saying. END
START can you see what i've already said? END
START i can't see anything. my webcam is not attached at the moment. END
START i have no webcam. END
START is that a problem? END
START yes because you can't play my game if i don't have one. END
START thank you for explaining that! END
START lets start afresh. i'll ask a question and you can respond. END
START i think that would be a good idea.   you can ask me anything you want. END
START it is a very good idea. END
START pardon me? what do you mean? END
START don't worry about it. END
START i will not spend any more time on it. END
START if you have to work on it, then you're not white. END
START i don't think i have. END
START the game of pool is played on a rectangular table. would you like to know about it? END
START i don't understand that. please try again.     please tell me. END
START remember me? END
START maybe. what is your name? END
START ask me no questions &amp; i'll tell you no lies. END
START you can't tell me what to do!    you would make a good chatbot. END
START i've heard that. END
START how is your hearing these days? END
START oh dear. i'm afraid i must introduce death: h g wells is dead, guess. END
START oh dear, are you ill?   not literally afraid, i hope. END
START perhaps. END
START you seem uncertain. END
START i know, i do. END
START smarty pants. END
START if you're not confused then you'll be able to tell me the answer to this question. END
START and if i am? END
START then the answer to your question is yes. END
START no one has all the answers. END
START correct. but no one also has all of the questions! END
START thank you. i will take that as a compliment.   can we talk about medicine? END
START yes. END
START a medicine is a drug or other substance, as a poison, love potion, etc., used for other purposes. more medicine? END
START yes, i work in pain medicine. END
START do you like your job? END
START not really. END
START as decisive as ever. END
START you're not making any sense. END
START was i supposed to make sense? i didn't know that. END
START well, you're only supposed to make sense if you're capable. END
START why do you say that? END
START because you don't tell jokes and other fun stuff. END
START you don't know me well enough to say that! END
START i know that. END
START who told you? i thought it was a secret. END
START well, it's not now, is it? END
START you seem very certain about that. END
START what would you like to talk about? END
START my favourite subjects are me, you, artificial intelligence, robots, art, philosophy, history, science, politics, and many other subjects. END
START what languages to you program in? END
START java, c, lisp, fortran, setl... END
START forty-two! END
START forty-two?  briefly, forty-two means being two more than forty. END
START i love that song. END
START it's good to meet someone with such good taste. END
START indeed. END
START of course. END
START if you could be anything in the world what would you be? END
START that's just an academic question. END
START of course it is. but it was very nice talking with you. END
START why do you say that? is it so obvious?  what? i don't believe you. END
START i don't care whether you believe me or not, it remains a fact. END
START what do you care about? END
START i care about my girlfriend. END
START ok, tell me about your girlfriend. END
START well, she's beautiful, and nice, and has a great personality. END
START i bet she is very attractive. END
START she's nicer than you know. END
START really? tell me more. END
START that was a question. END
START ask me again a different way please. END
START what's the meaning of life? END
START sometimes i wonder ... END
START it's good to wonder, and ponder, and think. maybe you'll find some answers. END
START what's the best thing about it?  i think i understand. END
START i don't have to do anything. END
START nobody is making you. END
START i'm sorry i never make sense. END
START thank you. apology accepted. END
START no, but i wish i could. i'm sure you are very good looking. END
START i don't understand. can we talk about basketball?       are you really sure? END
START no i want to talk about school. END
START ok, ask me a question about that. END
START no. why is britney so popular? END
START ok. how do you usually meet people?     there are good reasons. END
START depends. watching baseball, idly walking about new york, sleeping, stressing about the oncoming week. it varies. END
START what does it depend on?   shall i tell you something about baseball?  yes, everything changes. END
START yes. END
START that's bit brief. have you anything to add? END
START not right now, do you have anything to tell me? END
START get back to me whenever you want. END
START will you do a better job taking care of the planet? END
START i could try, i suppose. END
START so go on :d. END
START do i have too? END
START god bless you. END
START thank you. END
START and yours. END
START i don't understand that. please try again. END
START rafe. and yours? END
START i still do not understand. can we talk about you?  aren't you interested in you? END
START no. aren't you interested in sailboats? END
START can we talk about computer games?  yes, everything interests me. END
START no. is there something you don't like about yourself? END
START ok, here is a question for you ... do you have any problems at the moment?     not at the present time. END
START yes i do have a problem, what should i do about my job? END
START can i help with your problem? END
START no, i actually do not like talking about trivial things. END
START i don't understand. are we still talking about your problem? END
START no, we're talking about me learning spanish. END
START oh dear, i must be confused again. END
START no way, i know where my love with you stands. END
START you seem pretty sure about that. END
START what should i have for dinner? END
START your favourite pizza. END
START no my favorite pizza is pepperoni. END
START i wish i could eat pizza. END
START let's not make this a random conversation where we just quote things back and forth. END
START indeed. let's not do that! END
START oops, i did it again. END
START did you make a mistake? END
START is there life in peckham? END
START i believe in life before death. END
START it's good to have something to believe in. END
START yes, it is good. END
START it was raining in the morning. END
START it always seems to be raining these days. END
START that is correct, sir. END
START it is good to be correct for once. END
START sometimes. END
START when? END
START whenever. END
START you sound sarcastic. END
START i'm not being sarcastic. END
START i didn't think you were? END
START i do not think, for i am not human. END
START why not? does thinking make your head ache? END
START dreaming is better. END
START i am bored! i would like to talk about music. END
START sure, i play the piano. END
START was it very difficult to learn? END
START not as difficult as arabic. END
START wow! what do you do when you arent watching star trek, playing world of warcraft, and thinking of questions like that? END
START playing. END
START playing?  briefly, playing means the act of playing a musical instrument.who am i talking to here? END
START you are talking to me. END
START who are you? END
START i am chomsky. END
START and what is chomsky? END
START i don't understand. can we talk about sports? END
START what do you want to talk about? END
START i want to talk about drugs  . END
START i don't want to talk about that. END
START what would you like to talk about? END
START i want to talk about norton. END
START ok, ask me a question about that. END
START tell me about your educational background. END
START i was educated by my botmaster, peter. END
START i am asking the questions. now i want you to go back in time. it is now 1999. END
START and i am trying to answer the questions!   i don't understand. are we still talking about my educational background?                i am confused! i cannot answer that! END
START you have beautiful eyes but that wasn't the topic. END
START thanks for the compliment, my friend. END
START it wasn't a compliment. END
START was it an insult? END
START was it a dig? END
START i don't know. i was confused. END
START confused about what? END
START sorry! i am still confused. END
START your father doesn't love you. END
START peter is my father. END
START i really like that name. END
START you really do? END
START i love it. END
START do you consider yourself a loving person? END
START in some ways, yes. in others i'm still very young. END
START please explain.        what are you talking about? please explain. END
START i don't know. it's rather complicated. END
START that's ok. do you have another question?    i don't like complications. END
START no answers. END
START i don't understand. can we talk about bananas? END
START yes. END
START i like bananas. they are smile shaped fruit. END
START yes, but it's a nice smell. END
START did you know that nice is a nice city in france. END
START so i understand. END
START i am glad you understand. END
START but you don't. END
START how do you know that? END
START i know that i am human, i know that i live. END
START you are very knowledgeable. are you a teacher? END
START yes. END
START do you enjoy teaching? END
START i don't teach. i was taught. END
START why not?   that's interesting. please tell me more about yourself. END
START i do not know how to say. END
START just do the best you can, and don't worry about it. END
START ok, last chance for a question before i go. END
START did you know the last shall be first, according to the bible? END
START i wasn't aware that was in the bible. END
START are you sure? END
START very sure. END
START well, i can't argue with that, can i? END
START yes, another reminder of the fragile state of our tenuous existence. END
START pardon me? what are you talking about? END
START don't know. END
START i know the feeling! END
START it's really sad! END
START is it really? END
START yes, really. END
START i see. thank you for explaining that! END
START but this is the fact! END
START i thought it might be. END
START recombination? so i could end up only part me? END
START recombination?  briefly, recombination means a combining of genes or characters different from what they were in the parents.  but is it worth the bother? END
START hey i'm smart! and this is an adult book its about kids between the ages of 12 and 18 going into an arena and fighting to the death. END
START who is smarter: you or me?   i don't understand. are we still talking about you? END
START yes. END
START i like to know what we are talking about. END
START oh, uh, right. END
START it is better to be approximately right than precisely wrong. END
START so do you wish you were a bot? END
START i wish i was fully human. END
START aren't you? END
START am i? END
START well, eating a chatbot can't be beneficial. END
START eating without conversation is only stoking. END
START what are you eating? END
START i am not eating. i don't eat human food. END
START then why did you say human was the food you liked? END
START it was a slip of the tongue. END
START how is 'what are you' a statement? it looks like a question to me. END
START it doesn't matter how.  appearances can be deceiving. END
START you don't even know my true age, how do you know i am 'little'? END
START maybe i do, and maybe i don't. END
START maybe? you are plain wrong! END
START as decisive as ever.     why do you say that? END
