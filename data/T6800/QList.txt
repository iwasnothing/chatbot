START you think so? END
START not really. END
START as decisive as ever. END
START you're not making any sense. END
START was i supposed to make sense? i didn't know that. END
START well, you're only supposed to make sense if you're capable. END
START why do you say that? END
START because you are. i'm not going to lie about something i believe. END
START i am what i am.   what will you do instead? END
START ramble! it's good for the soul. END
START ramble?  briefly, ramble means a leisurely walk (usually in some public place).  what's the best thing about it? END
START are you human? END
START i am computer software in a robot body. END
START i hope so, too. my human body is on its last legs. END
START so do i.   did you know the last shall be first, according to the bible? END
