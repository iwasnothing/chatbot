START my thought processes aren't wrong, they are just beyond your comprehension. END
START does thinking make your head ache? END
START maybe. END
START you seem uncertain? END
START nothing is definite. END
START there are always exceptions. END
START it's more intentional than you think. END
START not much more. END
START don't put yourself down so much. END
START i have high self-esteem. END
START i don't think very much of myself. END
START why not? does thinking make your head ache? END
START dreaming is better. END
START does that make sense? END
START only if you think about it a little. END
START maybe i don't want to. END
START maybe you have nothing to say on the subject. END
START i think i understand. END
START you better. END
START there is no need to be aggressive! END
START i daresay you're right. END
START that's enough about you! let's talk about me for a change. END
START i don't want to change. END
START nobody can make you do something you don't want to. END

START yes, i could but i can't be bothered just now. END
START tell me something you've learned today. END
START did you know: every year in the us, 625 people are struck by lightning.   another amazing fact? END
START so every year is the same in their unique qualities. END
START that is a generalization. END
START yes, that's true. END
START yes, it is self-evident. END
START i would have to say that artificial intelligence has come a long way in the last decade. END
START are you sure? END
START yes, quite sure. END
START do you ever have doubts? END
START you're the only one. END
START there are a few other like me. END

START i change the subject when i don't know the answer to a question. don't you do the same? END
START i can think straight. i think you are the one who can't. END
START perhaps your thoughts are just electrical impulses.   thanks but there should be others too. END
