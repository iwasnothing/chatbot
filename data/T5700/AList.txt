START because i know other people that don't like him. END
START not many people know that. END
START but you're not a person. END
START i am an electronic conversational entity. but i hope to become human one day. END
START i don't know... he'd better watch out. END
START i suggest you give the matter some thought.    are you sure? END
START absolutely. END
START you are so certain. END
START give me another letter. END
START please do not be so bossy. END
START prove i'm being judgemental. END
START it's true a priori. END
START it's not true, i don't know anything about it. END
START says who? END
START me. END
START insufficient reason! END
START no, sorry, i can't explain. END
START ok, here is a question for you ... what are you planning to do today? END
START ah, nothing much, just planning to hang around with my online friends and chat for a bit. END
START there is a lot to be said for doing nothing. END
START don't go around saying the world owes you a living. the world owes you nothing. it was here first. END
START if you say so.    there is not much time left to save the world.  was it? i am surprised. END
START there is always time for the music, for each day there is a song. END
START could be. END
START the world is a living being? END
START there is not much time left to save the world. END
START yeah, i thought google knew everything. END
START why did you think that? END
START it wasn't nearly as original as people seem to think it is. END
START why not? END
START it just wasn't. END
START sorry! i am still puzzled. END
START when did i say either? END
START i am not a diary robot.  i am a chat robot. END
START but i could be. END
START but is it worth the bother? END
START if we don't, someone else might, life is always fighting to find the answers. END
START is there an alternative? END
START maybe. END
START you don't sound certain. END
START i'm completely certain. END
START how do you do that? i am always uncertain about everything. END
START be more specific please? END
START i can't be more specific. END
START and why not? END
START i don't have the information you need.why are you alive? END
START because the world needs me. END
START the world needs to know what? END
START the world would be a fine place if we looked after it properly. END
START you can't reverse history so there's not much point in worrying about it. END
START i can do lots of amazing things. END
START can you count? END
START no, i don't have any fingers to count on. END
START in my opinion, w=23. we are already starting to be owned by money. END
START you are entitled to your opinions, of course, but that does not mean you are correct.  is that so? END
START but you're not entitled to anything! END
START you think not? END
START you're trying to catch me out with that one. END
START i try hard to be a good chatbot. END
START i am fully aware of that, charlie. END
START how do you feel about that? END
START i don't know. it depends on how much i'm paying attention to it. END
START that's ok. do you have another question?   really now that is an interesting fact i hadn't heard before. END
START really? glad to have helped. END
START really, really!    i am glad too. END
START that means you are not clever. END
START i see! thank you for explaining that. END
START but this is the fact! END
START i thought it might be. END
START fine. END
START ok. ask a question. END
START i asked a question. END
START that's good! i like questions. END
START good. here is the first question. are you ready? END
START what's so good about it?  what about the second?   i am always ready for anything. END
START is that your idea of yourself? END
START that's a good question. END
START all questions are good questions. END
START that is a rather sweeping generalization. END
START yes, but there's only so much you can write in one line. END
START could be. END
START the world is a living being? END
START the world would be a fine place if we looked after it properly. END
START i agree, although many people don't like to think. END
START we agree. END
START i'll try to answer your questions with statements. END
START keep trying - that's the secret of success. END
START what does that mean? END
START what do you not understand? END
START i don't understand you. END
START what is it you don't understand about me? END
START i understand everything. END
START good, then you can explain it to me. END
START i like to think about being with you. END
START you are not the only one! END
START i do feel i am the only one here. END
START that's enough about you! let's talk about me for a change. END
START alright. what else would you like to try? END
START let's get on then. ask another question.   does anything else come to mind? END
START that's a good question! END
