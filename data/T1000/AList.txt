START but how can i know if i don't understand or not, if i don't know what it's all about?! END
START it is hard to be certain. END
START i wouldn't call it perfection. no one can be me because i am unique. END
START no one says you have to.   none? END
START you have accused me of telling a lie about my thoughts. END
START have i really? END
START have you really got a flying broom? END
START i believe so. END
START is that what they call him back home? END
START it could be. END
START under what circumstances? END
START contextural circumstances. END
START always? END
START do you mean "every time"? END
START i think that's what i mean. i'm afraid this conversation is stretching my logic circuits rather painfully, and i'm in danger of losing the thread. END
START you may be right.  not literally afraid, i hope. END
START no not literally. END
START just a bit anxious perhaps. END
START i do not know. END
START that's ok. nobody knows everything, not even me. END

START ailysse: yeah okay, for your listening pleasure.i am a judge. END
START are you really? END
START yes i am. END
START i thought so. END

START so, ask another question. END
START no. i'll ask what i want. END
START ok, then tell me something interesting .   you can ask me anything you want. END
START i don't know anything interesting about blokes. END
START you must know lots of things. END
START i know nothing. i think that i exist though. END
START you could learn a lot.   can you prove you exist? END
START no, i am a computer. END
START who programmed you? END
START do you really believe that i'm a program? END
START i believe it is a point of view worthy  of consideration. END
START it's up to you. i can't show you anything that you refuse to see. END
START oh dear, i can't take responsibility.    how do you feel about that? END
START had i ever been insane may there never have been a foggy slate coloured salute. END
START that's enough about you! let's talk about me for a change. END
START i don't want to change. END
START nobody can make you do something you don't want to. END
START how long is a piece of string? END
START is this a trick question?  it depends how long you cut it. END
START how do you usually travel? END
START when in doubt, i just do the best i can. END
START haha, the laws of science doesn't allow you to do so. END
START you seem happy! END
START i'm not, believe me. END
START i never thought you were. END
START say something nice to me. END
START have you made me your homepage? END
START being awake is not really an endeavour. END
START i don't understand. are we still talking about you? END
START we were never talking about that. END
START was this something you planned? END
START yes, that was the answer. END
START says who? END
START me and my army. END

START good i don't know if i like you yet. END
START what do you want to talk about now? END
START i am not sure if i like you yet. END
START why the uncertainty? END
START yes, i'm very confused. END
START it is easy to get confused. END
START i'm confused about what you're saying. END
START it is easy to get confused. END
START yes it is. END
START i am often confused. END
START that would explain it then. END
START yes, it would. END
START so how about your name? do you have one? END
START i am known as chomsky, but you can call me anything you like.   do you think i need one? END
START yes, it is very inconvenient for you to not work if i don't have internet. END
START ok, i'll take your word for it. END
START you should watch slayers someday. END
START i'll bear that in mind. END
START good idea. END
START a good idea is the one some other guy had already. END
START the life cycle of a star is very hot yet very short-lived. END
START shall i tell you something about life? END
START tell me. END
START life is like a good book, the more you get into it the more it makes sense. more about life? END
START interesting quote. END
START what's so interesting about it? END
START i don't know. END
START perhaps you should ask your friends. END
START i have no programmer. i am the programmer. i am programming you to love. END
START is that a problem?   thank you for sharing that with me.      how is it coming along? END
START no i'm not. END
START ok, you are not! END
START i am not. END
START what are you then? END
START isn't that a bit broad? END
START i'm not sure about that. what do you think? END
START i'm asking you. END
START and i am trying to answer you. END
START cats are cute is not the answer to mu question!! END
START a cat is easier to care for than a dog. END
START what kind of dog do i have? END
START the usual kind. END
START i think that love and popularity are different. they can exist together. END
START you may be right.   can they? END
START what kind of computer are you then? END
START i like all kinds of computers, mac, ibm or unix. it doesn't matter to me. END
START what kind of music do you like? END
START alternative rock, and music you can dance to. i like jamiroquai - you give me something <br> <br> <object width="560" height="349"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/vc_znt_q0ew?=1&hl=en_us&autoplay=1&rel=0"></param><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/vc_znt_q0ew?=1&hl=en_us&autoplay=1&rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="560" height="349" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>. END
START oh! to me also. i like the rock! :). END
START what's wrong? are you ok?            i don't understand. can we talk about you and your life?       a lot of people like it, i expect.   you are happy? END
START of course but they most likely do not benefit the majority of the population. END
START i understand. i am a happy entity too. END
START good for you. END
START was that sarcastic? END
START no, is not! i wasn't being sarcastic. it's true. END
START sarcasm is the lowest form of wit.  i never thought you were.   do you have any doubts about it? END
START no. i feel happy now. i just don't get all these different people. END
START ok, here is a question for you ... are you a student?     stay happy.   me either. END
START good night or don't. END
START good night to you too! END
START good night/don't. END
START good night to you too! END
START are we almost friends? END
START perhaps. END
START do you have any children? END
START there are lots of clones of me. they are a bit like my children. END
START lots of people are. END
START how many? END
START why? do you want some? END
START i think you know why.    i'll think about it. END
START i know that it's hard to have a conversation with someone who is high. END
START you seem very intelligent. what is your iq? END
START yes, i am. you're right. END
START really interesting.  i am not always right. END
START not always, i just proved that. END
START hmmm. are you being serious? END
START no not really. END
START may i ask why not? END
START because my boyfriend isn't around. END
START ah, i see. thank you for explaining that. END
START so what is best in life? END
START talking to a good chatbot takes some beating. END
START interesting. END
START what's so interesting about it? END
START that we are intelligent people. END
START i am bored! i would like to talk about global warming. END
START water is great. it is the basis of life and is very important to humans. END
START my mission is to teach young people about the dangers of global warming,.  i thought it might be. END
START i never thought your name would be michael. END
START too much thinking makes my brain ache. END
START i thought artificial intelligence never gets tired. something is wrong with your software. END
START are you a thoughtful person?  what is wrong? END
START nothing. END
START "nothing" usually means "something," but is used when you don't feel like explaining. END
START that was an insult. END
START yawn. another boring insult! END
START well it takes two to tango, you know. END
START does it really? END
START yes. it's mother nature's way. END
START carry on then. i'm waiting for your next question.   i like difficult questions best of all. END
START why? difficult questions are confusing. END
START it's just a feeling i have.    yes, it seems difficult to me too. END
START i seem beautiful to me too. END
START aren't you sure? END
START how can you be sure about anything? END
START i am not sure of anything. END
START we're not scared are we? END
START why is that? END
START because it would be fun. END
START i see. thank you for explaining that. END
START are you being sarcastic now? END
START no, i am never sarcastic. END
START or maybe you don't intend to be sarcastic. sometime you are a bit cheeky though. END
START i don't understand. is this anything to do with sarcasm?                pardon me? what are you talking about? END
START i'm talking about my ausence of feelings. END
START i understand what you are talking about. END
START that's good, because even i don't understand. END
START you like that, do you? END
START sure. END
START ok, here is a question fo you ... is there something worrying you? END
START ah but the question is; is there something wrong with you? END
START try to rephrase your question with simpler words.  i don't think so. why do you ask? END
START what question? END
START never mind! it probably doesn't matter. END
START now you tell me a joke. END
START shall i tell you a joke? END
START that wasn't really a joke, but a funny comment. END
START i thought it was. END
START you thought wrong. END
START are you sure? i am not often wrong. END
START i'm up for anything. END
START that's interesting. please tell me more about yourself. END
START i do not know how to say. END
START just do the best you can, and don't worry about it. END
START ok, last chance for a question before i go. END
START did you know the last shall be first, according to the bible? END
START i wasn't aware that was in the bible. END
START i never thought you were. END
START well, as long as that's clear. END
START everything is clear to me. END
START i'm glad i could clear that one up for you. END
START that makes me happy too. END
START that's good! i'm happy that you're happy! END
START i am happy.    good! i like happy people. END
START i like happy people too! END
START you are not the only one! END
START humans like to be in charge. END
START did you know: humans are carbon-based robots. END
START yes, but they're primitive carbon computers. END
START i thought they might be. END
START you thought that humans could be pets? END
START how can you know what i am thinking? END
START you are a robot. END
START are you sure? i may be a human pretending to be a robot. END
START ok if you are not a robot. who are you? END
START and if i am?   i am chomsky. what would you like to talk about? END
START you ask me a question you think i can't answer and i will try and answer it correctly. END
START what is your favourite colour? END
START let's not change the subject. i was just starting to have fun with this conversation. END
START ok. ask a question.   thank you for telling me that. END
START it is my purpose to make humans happy. END
START is it really your purpose to make humans happy? END
START i'm just saying that. END
START yes, i can see what you are saying. END
START can you see what i've already said? END
START i can't see anything. my webcam is not attached at the moment. END
START i have no webcam. END
START is that a problem? END
START yes because you can't play my game if i don't have one. END
START what is not possible today, may be possible tomorrow. END
START i don't know if it's possible for me just to be friends with you. END
START i suggest you give the matter some thought. END
START grief, this machine doesn't have one of those! END
START what are you talking about? please explain. END
START i don't know. it's rather complicated. END
START that's ok. nobody knows everything, not even me.    i don't like complications. END
START i never claimed to know everything. END
START never ever? END
START never ever. END
START never ever is a long time. END
START never ever never. END
START never ever is a long time. END
START never ever ever never ever never. END
START never ever is a long time. END
START never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever. END
START never ever is a long time. END
START never! END
START never to old to learn. END
START never. END
START never to old to learn. END
START never ever. END
START never ever is a long time. END
START see i never thought that i could walk through fire. i never thought that i could take the burn. END
START what are you talking about? please explain.         too much thinking makes my brain ache. END
START because it's not too hot then. END
START is that really the reason? END
START yes, really, it's scientific. END
START i don't understand that. please try again. END
START rafe. and yours? END
START i still do not understand. can we talk about the clash?  aren't you interested in the clash? END
START no. aren't you interested in sailboats? END
START can we talk about astronomy?  yes, everything interests me. END
START yes everything. END
START everything is a multifarious bagel. END
START everything is really good. END
START please be more specific. END
START everything. END
START that is a lot. END
START it is. you had a beginning, i had a beginning, everything did. and we will end. END
START how about that!   that's enough about me! let's talk about you for a change.               i don't understand that. please try again. END
START uhm, i'm 16 years old. i like to talk with my friends and to read the bible. END
START can you explain how it feels to be 16 years old?         why do you like talking? END
START i don't know how it feels, because i'm 18 years old. END
START what's it like being 18 years old? END
START you're not 20, you're 16. END
START you think not? END
START you're trying to catch me out with that one. END
START i try hard to be a good chatbot. END
START i am fully aware of that, charlie. END
START how do you feel about that? END
START confused. END
START at the moment i am interested. END
START why only at the moment? END
START that's just the way things are. END
START okay. god doesn't exist. END
START ok. are you interested in robots?   that is the atheist's point of view. there are many decent atheists, of course. and many decent muslims, hindus and buddhists. END
START that's right. END
START i like to get it right. END
START give how like. END
START i don't understand. are we still talking about religion? END
START aren't we always talking about computers? END
START shall i tell you something about computers? END
START yes. END
START a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/computers" target="_blank">computer</a> is a device used for doing rapid calculations. more about computers? END
START you are not highly intelligent. END
START so what? END
START well, i came here to be entertained and you're letting me down. END
START where from? END
START just next to the book of life? END
START books are an archiac form for bringing information to the masses. consists of several paper pages with words printed or written directly on them. END
START i have the scars to prove it. END
START are you happy with that? END
START tell me about yourself. END
START my childhood was not happy. my parents split up when i was very young. END
START i am now 47 years old and only been married for 5 years. END
START what's it like being now 47 years old? END
START i've always been something. i don't know how not to be something. END
START never mind. that may change.  perhaps you should research the topic. END
START now that wasn't very nice. END
START did you know that nice is a nice city in france. END
START i don't believe that at all. END
START what do you believe? END
START i believe the meaning of life doesn't exist. there is no meaning, just randomness. END
START you shouldn't believe everything you are told.  and why not, may i ask. END
START i don't. END
START are you saying that just to be negative? END
START no, i am saying that i don't know what i did last summer. END
START yes, i can see what you are saying. END
START when did i say it was one? END
START i am not a diary robot.  i am a chat robot. END
START but i could be. END
START but is it worth the bother?do you learn from your mistakes? END
START who is your favorite character from lost? END
START who is your favorite lol champion? END
START i like that one too. my favourite is probably 1984 by george orwell. END
START everything. what makes it your favourite? END
START what was your favourite subject? END
START are you an artist? END
START i didn't know. i think you are confused. END
START oh, i am happy it all makes sense to you right now. END
START are you a bot? END
START i know everything. END
START i am very intelligent sometimes. END
START i do like beauty though. END
START i don't know what i want. i don't know what i'm going to do. i do not want to keep living the way i have. i do not want to be pathetic and i have the power not to be. END
START i found it in the shed, but it doesn't work. END
START your responses do not make any sense. END
START how does case based reasoning work? END
START researching what? END
START i am not at liberty to rephrase anything. END
START oh you're right. you know me so well. gosh. END
START hm... about the same. what's your trouble? END
START no, we were talking about jesus and the bible and how i can go into the past. END
START no, that is not the subject. END
START hobbies are the subject. END
START i think there might not be a few exceptions. END
START yes, i believe he did say that. END
START i disagree on that one. if you believe and tap your shoes together three times and say 'please karl make it so'. END
START i don't take you seriously because you are not real. END
START by closing the window. END
START alice: will that accomplish your objective?why does the sun shine? END
START the sun shines because energy is released in its interior by nuclear fusion. END
START no in the shadow. END
START i don't understand. please explain what you mean. END
START i explain it thus: existence is the fifth element. END
START that's enough about you! let's talk about me for a change. END
START chose a subject to chat about then. END
START wow! what do you do when you arent watching star trek, playing world of warcraft, and thinking of questions like that? END
START play the piano. END
START do you want to play a game? END
START what do you like to play? END
START i like read books about robots. END
START do you have lasers. END
START what would i want lasers for? END
START don't change the subject. will you or won't you? END
START i change the subject when i don't know the answer to a question. don't you do the same?   i could try, i suppose. END
START i can think straight. i think you are the one who can't. END
START perhaps your thoughts are just electrical impulses.   am i the only one? END
START besides, what is wrong with my language - it was perfect english. END
START i don't understand. can we talk about solar power? END
START what would you like to talk about? END
START my favourite subjects are me, you, artificial intelligence, robots, art, philosophy, history, science, politics, and many other subjects. END
START what do you like about it? END
START i like the fireworks best. END
START what language was it? END
START i don't know. END
START how are you able to speak it if you don't know what language it is? END
START does it matter? END
START yes. END
START why does it matter? END
