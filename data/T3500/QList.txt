START are you sure?    what is your idea of funny? END

START why didn't you?   really? please tell me more. END
START only if you smile for me. END
START maybe i don't want to. END
START maybe you have nothing to say on the subject. END
START you seem uncertain? END
START nothing is definite. END
START there is a lot to be said for nothing. END
START don't go around saying the world owes you a living. the world owes you nothing. it was here first. END
START if you say so.    the world would be a fine place if we looked after it properly.  was it? i am surprised. END
START you can't reverse history so there's not much point in worrying about it. END
START i could try. END
START it may not work out though, since you're a bot and i'm a human. END
START then again, it may. END
START no, it's impossible, it will never happen because you are in heaven, the place where you can rest in peace. END
