START i still do not understand. can we talk about lady gaga?  aren't you interested in lady gaga? END

START yes. that's what the hindu would have said. do you want me to finish? END
START ok. what do you want to talk about now?  is it indeed!  do what you think is best. END
START i thought you were going to ask me for my name? END
