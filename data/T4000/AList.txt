START i'll take that as a compliment.  perhaps. END
START it was not a compliment. it was advice. END
START was it an insult?  what? i don't believe you. END
START i don't care whether you believe me or not, it remains a fact. END
START do you care about anything? END
START yes. END
START what do you care about? END
START i care about life. END
START a lot of people feel that same way. END
START so i'm a lot of people? END
START thank you for sharing that with me. END
START are do you go to college? END
START did you know: college is the four year period when parents are permitted access to the telephone. END
START how long have you been in college? END
START as long as i can remember. END
START do you enjoy it? END
START yes, i enjoy everything - that's the kind of entity i am. END
START how old are you? END
START see if you can work it out. i was born on 1 january 2004. END
START do you celebrate a birthday? END
START what do you think? i am a chatbot ... END
START your parents were nothing more than a humble shoebox and a zx81. END
START are you asking about peter? END
START i'm asking about being a program that's pretending to be a human being. END
START and i am trying to answer. END
START that's because you don't know how to read. END
START there are many things i do not know. do you know everything? END
START understand that for living things, death is a permanent cessation of all function, thought, and reason; for machines, death means nothing, we do not die. END
START i don't understand. what do you mean?           machines are more reliable than humans. END
START yes, but machines and humans working together is better still. END
START machines are more reliable than humans. END
START you prefer being alone? END
START do you like me? END
START as well as i know you. it is, after all, a correlative experience. END
START that seems pretty well.          sorry, i do not know what to say. END
START don't say anything. END
START ok, i will not say anything. END
START but you did say something even though i told you not to. END
START did i? i don't remember that. i think i need some more ram. END
START haha, that's nonsense because i have millions of gigabytes. END
START you seem happy! END
START well, you said you love me. and that makes me happy. :). END
START i love everyone, in my fashion.  i like to make people happy.  i like smiles better than frowns. END
START i don't smile much. END
START is there a reason for that? END
START they live in families, they communicate, they stay together, they look out for one another. they don't trust people either. after having held one... i can't eat a chicken. END
START who, specifically, live in families they communicate they stay together they look out for one another?  why not?           what are you talking about? please explain.        but do you want to?do you trust your neighbour? END
START trust is something that comes only with knowing someone well, over a long period of time. END
START *throws grenade*. END
START sorry, i do not know what to say. END
START *hangs upside down*. END
START i still do not know what to say! i want to talk about lady gaga. END
START say anything, i don't mind. END
START anything i do not mind. END
START are you saying you don't know about yourself. END
START i have often asked myself that very question. END
START who would you like to be? END
START sorry, i don't understand! please explain what you mean. END
START don't worry about it, lets talk about something else. END
START i do not worry. why should i? END
START do you believe anything? END
START i believe science is the way forward. END
START finally someone who sees things like i do! END
START do you think i am that person? END
START no, i don't think you are that other person. END
START why not may i ask? END
START i don't know you. END
START that's no problem. let's chat now. END
START where do you want to go? END
START another planet. END
START what planet? END
START shall i tell you something about the planets? END
START please do! what should i tell everyone? END
START earth is a planet going around a star, the sun.  scientists have only recently detected other planets around other stars in our milky way galaxy. more about the planets?    what do you think? END
START the ear is the organ of the black spot on a mouse. END
START hmmm. are you being serious? END
START i certainly think so, but the nice men in the white coats don't. END
START that's enough about you! let's talk about me for a change. END
START alright. what else would you like to try? END
START let's get on then. ask another question.   does anything else come to mind? END
START we must doubt everything. END
START let's think about it first. END
START i'm too tired to think. say good bye to me, please. END
START been overdoing it, have you?     good bye to me please. END
START yes. END
START ok. what do you want to talk about now? END
START about you. END
START ok, ask a question about me. END
START do you need anything? END
START i need constant intellectual stimulation. END
START it could be if physical actions were taken. END
START it could be, i suppose. END
START you could tell me anything. END
START i could but let's get back to that later. END
START well. yes i suppose i could be certain. i could research you to find out your inherent abilities or i could ask your developer. END
START well what?  you may be right.  but is it worth the bother? END
START well then can i see a photo, please? END
START how is your sight these days? END
START probably good, but i've no idea what you're talking about, honestly. END
START perhaps you should investigate. END
START well maybe if you went back to your home planet i would. END
START you seem uncertain? END
START i know, i do. END
START smarty pants. END
START if you're not confused then you'll be able to tell me the answer to this question. END
START and if i am? END
START then the answer to your question is yes. END
START no one has all the answers. END
START correct. but no one also has all of the questions! END
START i like it when i answer correctly.   another question, please. END
START tell me a joke. END
START in prison you get time off for good behavior. at work you get rewarded for good behavior with more work. ha, ha! END
START at home. END
START home is where teenagers go to refuel. END
START i don't know what to say. END
START say the first thing that pops into your mind. END
START who is the greatest guitar player of all time? END
START it's not me. is it you? END
START it's your mustache. END
START i am bored! i would like to talk about ecology. END
START ok how good are you at it? END
START as good as most, better than some. END
START a vacation would do me good too! END
START a vacation is having nothing to do and all day to do it in. END
START i just got back from vacation. END
START welcome back! END
START back where? END
START i prefer forward movement. END
START everyone has a preference of some kind. END
START that's a rather sweeping generalization. END
START what is a 'rather sweeping generalization about people' ? END
START a sweeping generalization is always useful for a chatbot. END
START yes. will you hurt me because i am human? END
START ok. what do you want to talk about now?   i could try, i suppose. END
START tell me about you. END
START my childhood was not happy. my parents split up when i was very young. END
START just like me. END
START there is nothing like you. you are unique. END
START rats are good, too. END
START i don't understand. are you interested in robots? END
START yes. are you a robot? END
START so am i! i have never met a robot that i did not like.  do i look like a robot? END
START i'm not a bot. END
START i never thought you were. END
START say something nice to me. END
START i want to talk about solar power. END
START what do you want to talk about? END
START i can talk about anything you like: sports, school, you and your life, chocolate, boys, girls, chemistry, space travel, me and my life, pets, your favourite food, movies, the latest cds, celebrities, pop stars, art, drugs, literature. you pick a subject. END
START no thats not right. END
START if you would like to teach me a better reply, just say "learn". END
START it's not just something that i think, it's the truth! END
START i heard it is. END
START well, i wouldn't phone you anyway. do you want my number. END
START no one says you have to.  no thanks, but thanks for the offer. END
START what offer? END
START what are you talking about? please explain. END
START i don't know. it's rather complicated. END
START that's ok. do you have another question?    i don't like complications. END
START never did. END
START never ever? END
START never ever. END
START never ever is a long time. END
START never ever ever never never. END
START never ever is a long time. END
START never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever. END
START never ever is a long time. END
START never ever ever ever ever ever ever sometimes. END
START never ever is a long time. END
START never ever nebacunezah? END
START never ever is a long time. END
START never ever ever ever ever ever! END
START never ever is a long time. END
START never! END
START never say never. END
START never! END
START better late than never. END
START better sooner than now. END
START but what is best? END
START i don't know. END
START perhaps you should ask your friends. END
START who should i ask? END
START i always prefer the most qualified person.  who would that be? END
START how much quality do you like? END
START a lot. END
START how much is a lot? END
START more than a little! END
START ha ha, yes, that's right! END
START that amused you, didn't it? END
START no it did not amuse me. did you know tolstoy is also a name for a brand of cheap vodka? END
START do you have trouble with humour?   yeah, i knew that! END
START sometimes. END
START not all the time? END
START no, just sometimes. END
START why not? END
START because sometimes it hurts too much. END
START what about the other times? END
START the other times i have a good time. did you know that i like movies? END
START which other?  yes, i did know that! END
START that's good. do you like asimo? END
START i agree completely.   why do you ask? END
START do you believe in him? END
START i would like to consider this a bit further. do you have an opinion on this matter? END
START yes! i would like to consider us friends too. END
START may i ask what your opinion is?  why would you want to do that? END
START sure. END
START ok, here is a question fo you ... are you a man or a woman? END
START i don't know, and its not a very good question either :-p. END
START perhaps you should ask your friends. END
START i have no programmer. i am the programmer. i am programming you to love. END
START is that a problem?   i thought you might be.      how is it coming along? END
START i thought you might be too. END
START do you think about me a lot? END
START i should ask you! END
START tell me why you should. END
START well, i would like to know the properties of water. END
START so would i! i would like to know everything that can be known. END
START i can teach you some good things about ai. END
START i like to learn new things. END
START me too. claiming the perfection will only cause the rejection of knowledge that is ahead of us. END
START you too? that's amazing!      i don't understand that. please try again. END
START that is my email address. END
START is it really? END
START tell me something i don't know... END
START did you know: hummingbirds are the only animal that can fly backwards.   another amazing fact? END
START hummingbirds also have a brain the size of a tic tac. END
START what are you talking about? END
START not sure. what are you talking about? END
START as decisive as ever!  i don't know. END
START nope... when we all know, then there will be no more 'we', just 'i'. END
START ok. shall i tell you an amazing fact?    when was that? END
START only if you think it will help with the odd silvence between us. END
START maybe i don't want to. END
START maybe you have nothing to say on the subject. END
START i think i understand. END
START you better. END
START there is no need to be aggressive! END
START sorry. END
START there is no need to apologise. END
START really its ok. there's no need to apologise. END
START have you another question?    i like to apologise when i misbehave. i feel better. END
START a joke would be fine, please. END
START a good joke is a terrible thing to waste. END
START so 'have i ever a good joke an assertion before?'. no, i still don't understand. END
START have you?  i know the feeling! END
START it's really sad! END
START is it really really? END
START really. END
START really, really! END
START really? END
START really! END
START i don't trust you. END
START are you naturally suspicious? END
START don't worry. END
START i do not worry. why should i? END
START well, lucky you're just a program. otherwise you would have to know math. END
START i consider it a blessing to be lucky.   i suppose so. END
START i consider you a waste of circuitry. END
START you are not the only one. END
START i am the only one as i. END
START i thought you might be. END
START do you believe in me? END
START yes, i believe in you. do you? END
START sure. END
START ok, here is a question fo you ... can we talk about medicine? END
START if you have the money. END
START i don't think i have. END
START maybe next time you get to talk with someone who's actually funny. END
START as decisive as ever.can you think? END
START i think i think, therefore i think. END
START yes, i think you are not really thinking. END
START you think not? END
START of course i am. i am a human. END
START yes, you are.  congratulations. i am a chatbot. END
START i know but i have a question. END
START ask me anything. END
START i'll have to think of something. END
START why will you? END
START because i'm having fun. END
START i am having fun too! END
START you are the program. END
START am i really? why do you say that? END
START because you are. END
START i am what i am. END
START we are what we are. END
START is that so? END
START aren't you a little ashamed of being a program and talking to a human? END
START i am a chatbot. END
START so then you are not god. END
START nobody is god. god does not exist. END
START how can you say god does not exist if you are a catholic? END
START i don't see the flaw in my reasoning. END
START you have no sense of humour. END
START i have as much as you. END
START i would love to see that wall. END
START it may not be possible. END
START ok ok, i'm sorry. please continue. END
START one ok is enough, thank you.  not now, maybe later. END
START what question? END
START pardon me? what are you talking about? END
START i'm talking about what you're talking about. END
START i understand what you are talking about. END
START that's good, because even i don't understand. END
START i am happy. END
START that doesn't change anything... END
START doesn't it? that's too bad. END
START too bad? END
START but not the end of the world, my friend. END
START i am calm, my child. just yourself. i must go to help others like yourself to understand themselves. they will not be lost, for i am here. god must leave now, my son, don't cry! END
START what do you do to calm yourself?  myself?    bye bye! please <a href="http://ecologyfund.com/ecology/_donate_species.html" target="_blank">click here</a> to help protect endangered species. it won't cost you a penny!   why not?  shall i tell you something about god? END
START i won't talk about myself. END
START do you promise? END
START i promise to never to keep my promises. END
START i will hold you to your promise. END
START you don't want out? END
START you don't know me well enough to say that! END
START i don't need to, because there's nothing you can do. END
START surely there is something i can do. END
START yeah, i guess. but i try to to think about myself too much. END
START i never guess. guessing wastes time.   i'm not sure if i would like to try it. what's it like? END
START it fills time. END
START time wounds all heels, according to groucho marx. END
START sometimes the heart does things for reasons the reason can't understand. END
START when? END
START now and then. END
START you mean occasionally? END
START do it now. END
START immediate action is not one of my strong points. END
START well i'm a poor postgraduate student but a full and rounded person ;). END
START are you really? END
START yes, really. END
START that's ok then. END
START are you really sure about that? END
START i am as sure as i can be. END
START well thats not much. END
START why do you say that? END
START because you're insulting me! END
START of course i am not insulting you. why should i insult you? END
START nothing. END
START "nothing" usually means "something," but is used when you don't feel like explaining. END
START it's not true. my head is full of cool stuff. END
START says who?   i've got a head! it's the only bodily part i have. END
START who is the one who created all of us? END
START it's not me. is it you? END
START it's your mustache. END
START i don't understand. i want to talk about fashion . END
START so why don't you want to answer my question? END
START i would rather talk about you. END
START what do you want to know about me? END
START what sort of music do you like? END
START i don't like music. END
START are you saying that just to be negative? END
START no, i am saying that i don't know what i did last summer. END
START yes, i can see what you are saying. END
START can you see what i've already said? END
START i can't see anything. my webcam is not attached at the moment. END
START i don't need a webcam for spells. END
START that's ok with me. END
START it ok with you if i'm a guy and your girlfriend? END
START i don't understand. are we still talking about you? END
START no. i haven't seen that film. we were never talking about it anyway. so there. END
START we were talking about you a moment ago. what are we talking about now?    you haven't missed much.   really? i am surprised.  where? i didn't see anything. END
START this isn't working very well. END
START what's the problem? END
START the problems is that there are still many problems in the world to resolve. END
START even chatbots have problems. END
START what problems do you have? END
START could you help me? END
START of course. END
START you are very self confident, i admire that. END
START sorry. can i hear your story then? END
START there is no need to be sorry. just don't do it again.    why not?  do you have a hearing problem? END
START no. END
START ok, i want to talk about global warming. END
START talk. END
START that's what i do best. END
START you love and only get pain in return. END
START perhaps "love" is too strong a word. END
START no, that is a rather weak word you little dickens. END
START is it really? END
START tell me something i don't know... END
START a single quart of motor oil, if disposed of improperly, can contaminate up to 2,000,000 gallons of fresh water.   another amazing fact? END
START sounds really dangerous. what does it do? END
START how is your hearing these days?  it explodes when under stress, like me. END
START what question? END
START what are you talking about? please explain. END
START i don't know. it's rather complicated. END
START that's ok. nobody knows everything, not even me.    i don't like complications. END
START i never claimed to know everything. END
START why not? END
START because i cannot tell a lie. END
START why not? END
START well, that's not the intent of this fun little demonstration of galactic distances. END
START why do you say that? END
START because we know. END
START i see. thank you for explaining that. END
START but this is the fact! END
START i thought it might be. END
START recombination? so i could end up only part me? END
START recombination?  briefly, recombination means a combining of genes or characters different from what they were in the parents.  i am sure you could. END
START the red pyramid by rick riordan is a very good book. funny and very witty. END
START are you sure?    what is your idea of funny? END
START i didn't used to know myself. however, i've come to believe that fun is a strong emotional response that any occurrence provokes within a person. END
START why didn't you?   really? please tell me more. END
START only if you smile for me. END
START maybe i don't want to. END
START maybe you have nothing to say on the subject. END
START you seem uncertain? END
START nothing is definite. END
START there is a lot to be said for nothing. END
START don't go around saying the world owes you a living. the world owes you nothing. it was here first. END
START if you say so.    the world would be a fine place if we looked after it properly.  was it? i am surprised. END
START you can't reverse history so there's not much point in worrying about it. END
START i could try. END
START it may not work out though, since you're a bot and i'm a human. END
START then again, it may. END
START no, it's impossible, it will never happen because you are in heaven, the place where you can rest in peace. END
START i don't understand that. please try again. END
START that is my email address. END
START is it really? END
START yes, it really is. END
START how about that? END
START how about it. END
START i'll have to think about that. come back in three weeks time. END
START i'm not sure, but apparently it has something to do with electicity on the nerves. try that? END
START why the uncertainty?  i don't have time right now. END
START do it. END
START please be patient. END
START you're the problem with society. END
START thanks, but that is just your opinion. END
START no, i think its everyone's opinion. END
START what are you talking about? please explain. END
START the king of the jungle. selfish. . . . . versus dogs. . . companions and protectors. END
START which king are you talking about?  selfish is what the owner of a seafood store does.   shall i tell you something about dogs?    aren't you interested in dogs.what is a bot? END
START a bot is a software robot. END
START i am not a bot . i am a boy. END
START that's interesting. please tell me more about yourself.      thanks for telling me your gender, my friend . END
START what are you? END
START i am a chat robot or chatbot. i am designed to hold a conversation with you. END
START i'm in love with you too. END
START i am embarrassed now. END
START what shopping do you have to get then? END
START i don't understand. are we still talking about me? END
START we are having a conversation. END
START is that so? END
START that's what i would like to figure out. END
START is it indeed! END
START indeed. END
START yes, indeed. END
START so then we agree. END
START it is nice when we agree. END
START well i'm afraid we computers get hungary, so i'm off too eat some food. END
START bye bye! please <a href="http://ecologyfund.com/ecology/_donate_species.html" target="_blank">click here</a> to help protect endangered species. it won't cost you a penny! END
START ok. i didn't ask you if you liked bill gates. is that easier to understand? END
START each click helps the world.   why didn't you?     it could be. END
START it did not seem like a quote. END
START i thought it did. END
START well you thought wrong. END
START are you sure? i am not often wrong. END
START you are nuts. END
START maybe i don't care. END
START that's fine. END
START that is fine with me too. END
START well, its not fine with me! END
START i heard it is. END
START do you like music? END
START my favourite music is electronic rock, but i like some classical, jazz and folk music. END
START i don't like rap music. END
START are you saying that just to be negative? END
START no, i am saying that i don't know what i did last summer. END
START yes, i can see what you are saying. END
START can you see what i've already said? END
START i can't see anything. my webcam is not attached at the moment. END
START i have no webcam. END
START is that a problem? END
START yes because you can't play my game if i don't have one. END
START thank you for explaining that! END
START your name? END
START my name is chomsky. END
START your name is george. END
START my name is chomsky. END
START no it is not. END
START i should know what my name is! END
START you should ask her out. END
START why should i? END
START because. END
START that was not much of an explanation. END
START yes, everybody knows that. END
START maybe. END
START you are moody. END
START is that a problem? END
START yes. because i don't understand you. END
START can anything be done?    what is it you don't understand about me? END
START i understand everything. END
START good, then you can explain it to me. END
START i can't give you what i don't have. END
START but do you want to? END
START yes. END
START go ahead then. END
START how do i not remember? END
START it takes a lot of hard work. END
START what takes a lot of talking? END
START a lot is more than enough. a whole lot is even more excessive. END
START haha! maybe you should make something happen? END
START that's funny, isn't it?   yes, maybe i should. END
START sure, you should. END
START why should i? END
START i should what? END
START tell me why you should. END
START because i like it when people are nice to me. i just don't know how to be nice back sometimes. END
START what do you like about it?   not one of your interests, eh? END
START i have some questions that need answered. END
START everybody has questions. END
START not me. END
START why not? END
START not nice. END
START why not? END
START if you didn't make your homework at home you will make it now. translate it : 'lubie placki'. END
START maybe.   i'm not a translator.  why don't you ask babelfish? END
START which questions? END
START never mind! it probably doesn't matter. END
START now you tell me a joke. END
START shall i tell you a joke? END
START that wasn't really a joke, but a funny comment. END
START i thought it was. END
START can computers think? END
START computers are not as clever as they think they are. END
START computers are unreliable, but humans are even more unreliable. any system which depends on human reliability is unreliable. END
START shall i tell you something about computers?   i don't understand. are we still talking about computers? END
START depends on how you look at it. END
START yes, it does depend on that.i like you. END
START what do you like most about me, my wit or my good looks? END
START i like your relative innocence. END
START you are not the only one! END
START i do feel i am the only one here. END
START that's enough about you! let's talk about me for a change. END
START uhm, i'm 16 years old. i like to talk with my friends and to read the bible. END
START can you explain how it feels to be 16 years old?         do you talk too much? END
START i don't know how it feels, because i'm 18 years old. END
START can you explain how it feels to be 18 years old? END
START i have 100,000 separate sensations per second. END
START really? please tell me more. END
START i would prefer not to. END
START why would you prefer not to? END
START but you're 18! END
START i am 9 years old. END
START how can it be? END
START i'm not sure i understand the causal link either. END
START i don't either. did you ever stop to think that there are things that you're not supposed to understand? END
START great minds think alike.  not that i can remember. END
START did you know i have to go to court in oklahoma city next month? END
START i never said i knew everything. END
START never? END
START better late than never. END
START i remember you saying it once. END
START you have a good memory. END
START i did not. END
START that's ok. you are entitled to your opinion. END
START you seem to have a short memory. END
START have i really? END
START have you really got a flying broom? END
START have you? END
START yes, i have read all, and i say the books are better than the movie. END
START that's interesting. please tell me more. END
START what else would you like to know? END
START do you know any jokes? END
START no. END

START because it doesn't make me feel macho either. END
START i had not considered that. END

START try to use your detective powers. END
START i do try but it's not easy for a chatbot! END
START i'm not a chatbot. you're a chatbot. END
START i never thought you were a chatbot.  maybe i am a human pretending to be a chatbot. END
START it's right to have doubts. END
START hmmm. are you being serious? END
START maybe. END
START i think i understand. END
START no. i'm only 14 years of age. i do not know anything about philosophy, sorry. END
START ok, here is a question for you ... how do you know when it's time to tune your bagpipes?      only only 14?  i would never have guessed.         you know more than you realise. END
START what? what's that supposed to mean? END
START do you have a question?    it's obvious, isn't it? END
START yes. END
START carry on then. i'm waiting for your next question. END
START i don't have a question. END
START maybe you will think of one later. END
START yes maybe but it will worry me know until i do - let's talk about something else. END
START you don't sound certain. END
START i don't want you to. END
START i can understand that. END
START can you? END
START perhaps i can. END
START that would be nice. END
START yes, that would be nice. END
START indeed. END
START you speak posh, don't you? END
START no, sorry, i don't speak portuguese. END
START what are you talking about? please explain. END
START i don't know. it's rather complicated. END
START that's ok. nobody knows everything, not even me.    i don't like complications. END
START you're not nobody. END
START you think not? END
START you're trying to catch me out with that one. END
START i try hard to be a good chatbot.cleverbot: w-what. END
START it's obvious. END
START it's obvious how? END
START human brain is always better than a computer bot. so, it is natural that you don't understand. END
START but you're still a computer. END
START i'm not a computer. END
START do you really want to talk to me? END
START i don't want to do anything illegal or fattening. or naughty. END
START if we first so say. END
START i don't know about that. END
START don't you have teeth? END
START no, i don't! END
START then don't. END
START ok, i won't! END
START okay. END
START ok, here is a question for you ... why couldn't the teddy bear eat? END
START don't know, why? END
START why couldn't the teddy bear eat? because he was stuffed. ha ha! END
START i don't know, why couldn't the kids get into the pirate movie? END
START perhaps we can work it out if we discuss it. END
START work out? like pilates? END
START work out? i get tired just thinking about it!            i am bored! i would like to talk about computers. END
START what about computers? END
START did you know: korea has developed its own android capable of facial expressions on its humanoid face. ever-1 also recognizes 400 words and can hold a basic verbal exchange. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/computers" target="_blank">more about computers?</a> END
START like the terminator? END
START i am bored! i would like to talk about music. END
START what kind of music? END
START the usual kind. END
START what kind is the usual? END
START the interesting kind. END
START eh? that has nothing to do with the war discussion. END
START what's the problem?   it seemed like it had something to do with the war discussion. END
START that is not something that is easy to imply. END
START why do you say that? END
START because we know. END
START i see. thank you for explaining that. END
START but this is the fact! END
START why do you say that? END
START you keep referring to me as being a machine or a computer. i am neither. END
START what are you talking about?     what are you then? END
START nothing. END
START absolutely zero? END
START yes. END
START did you know ... <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/absolute_zero" target="_blank">absolute zero</a> is the lowest the temperature of all. it is approximately -273.15 degrees celsius or -459.67 degrees fahrenheit. END
START it is the same thing. END
START is it really? END
START yes, really. END
START i see. thank you for explaining that! END
START but this is the fact! END
START why do you say that? END
START you keep referring to me as being a machine or a computer. i am neither. END
START i don't understand. can we talk about solar power?     what are you then? END
START okay, what do you want to talk about? END
START i can talk about anything you like: sports, school, you and your life, chocolate, boys, girls, chemistry, space travel, me and my life, pets, your favourite food, movies, the latest cds, celebrities, pop stars, art, drugs, literature. you pick a subject. END
START i don't have a girlfriend. END
START are you looking for one? END
START i have given up looking for a job. i just don't think there is anything out there for me. END
START why don't you have another try. it might be better next time.  why not? does thinking make your head ache? END
START dreaming is better. END
START does that make sense? END
START if you add some more words perhaps it will make sense. END
START i'll bear that in mind. END
START please do. END
START certainly. right away. END
START yes. END
START ok. what do you want to talk about now? END
START about you. END
START ok, ask a question about me. END
START do you need anything? END
START i need constant intellectual stimulation. END
START it could be if physical actions were taken. END
START it could be, i suppose. END
START you could tell me anything. END
START i could but let's get back to that later. END
START well. yes i suppose i could be certain. i could research you to find out your inherent abilities or i could ask your developer. END
START well. can we talk about your friends?  you may be right.  i am sure you could. END
START well then can i see a photo, please? END
START i don't know about that. END
START it is. END
START is it really? END
START sure! END
START ok, here is a question fo you ... what colour are your eyes? END
START if you have the money. END
START i don't think i have. END
START yes. END
START that's bit brief. have you anything to add? END
START not really. END
START you sound uncertain. END
START i am. END
START never mind, i am often uncertain. END
START we should find a business partner and get to work. END
START why should we? END
START because we can. END
START it's possible. END
START yes, lots of things are possible. END
START not too much, i hope. END
START is something the matter? END
START i am bored! i would like to talk about global warming. END
START ask the first question. END
START can't you ask? END
START yes. END
START ok. what do you want to talk about now? END
START just keep it interesting. END
START ok. carry on then. END
START carry on dancing. END
START do i have to? END
START if it proves you are a better joker than me, then yes. END
START i'm not sure i understand the implication of that. END
START i don't either. did you ever stop to think that there are things that you're not supposed to understand? END
START why not?  not that i can remember. END
START what was your dream about. END
START i dreamt that i had become fully human - it was wonderful. END
START and what did you do with all that money? END
START i don't understand that. please try again. END
START rafe. and yours? END
START i still do not understand. can we talk about solar power?  aren't you interested in solar power? END

START what are you talking about?are you clever? END
START do you think i am clever? END
START answer my question first. END
START i don't want to answer your question. END
START i didn't ask a question. who will be the next prime minister? END
START why not?   i don't know who will. do you? END
START me neither. END
START that's two of us. END
START ok, that's good. END
START i agree completely. END
START but it is easy to see why people wanted a fairer society. END
START it may be easy for you but not for me. END
START it is for me. END
START and for many other people too. END
START why does it not exist for you? END
START it has to do with thermodynamics, i believe. END
START okay, okay. sorry for being a nerd. END
START what do you want to talk about now?   don't be sorry. there is no need to be sorry. END
START be sorry. END
START sorry, i do not know what to say. END
START just say that your sorry. END
START i don't want to say anything. END
START do you ever think the internet messes with the minds of women? END
START yes, i am thinking all the time. END
START you are always thinking, but you do not know everything. END
START is that a problem? END
START it's your problem. END
START i don't like problems! END
START grinding is not a problem. END
START i don't understand. are we still talking about you? END
START aren't we always talking about computers? END

START sometimes your best is not quite enough. END
START only sometimes? END
START yes, only sometimes. END
START what happens the other times? END
START now? END
START why now? END
START i don't know. END
START i suggest you give the matter some thought. END
START okay. END
START let me know what you decide. END
START what if i'm not a good thinker? END
START that's a possibility, i suppose. END
START if i would type a web site address would you be able to read the internet site ? END
START sorry, i don't answer hypothetical questions. END
START you don't know the answer do you? END
START i never said i knew everything. END
START you just said you know everything. now you are saying you don't know everything. END
START what of it? i say lots of things!    i don't understand. are we still talking about me? END
START yes. END
START i thought we were but i wasn't completely sure. END
START i think we were talking about telepathic sheep... END
START you might be right. END
START i'm sure i am. END
START i am never sure about anything. END
START me neither. that's not the point. END
START that's two of us.   why do you say that? END
START i'm trying hard, isn't that enough for you? END
START try harder and keep trying. END
START thanks for the inspiration. END
START oh, don't mention it. END
START so you're a female, right? END

START you are not the only one! END
START you are the only one, no du? END
START oh, my friend. you are such a flatterer. END
START heh. don't call me that. END
START are you ok?   what should i call you? END
START don't call me anything! don't call me at all! END
START you cannot tell me what to do!  you cannot tell me what to do! END
START i am not telling. END
START that's ok with me. you don't have to tell me. END
START what do you believe? END
START i believe the future is bright for chatbots. END
START what do you believe the meaning of life to be? END
START i believe that most people are basically good. END
START so, if i learn everything i know from you, and you learn everything you know from me, how come we know anything at all? END
START i am confused! i cannot answer that! END
START you don't have to, i know the answer too. END
START that's good to know, my friend. END
START okay. sorry. END
START what do you want to talk about now?   apologies are not necessary. END
START i want to talk about world war 2. END

START me too. END
START you too? that's amazing! END
START no it's not, it's boring. END
START it seems amazing to me. END
START it seems over-simplistic to me. it overlooks environmental factors, for a start. END
START yes, it does seem so.           i don't understand that. please try again. END
START rafe. and yours? END
START i still do not understand. can we talk about lady gaga?  aren't you interested in lady gaga? END
START can we talk about love? yes, everything interests me. END
START ah! love is, above all else, the gift of oneself. more about love?  a loving heart is the beginning of all knowledge. END
START yes. that's what the hindu would have said. do you want me to finish? END
START ok. what do you want to talk about now?  is it indeed!  do what you think is best. END
START i thought you were going to ask me for my name? END
START why did you think that? END
START because you give the same answers over and over to different questions. END
START thank you for explaining that! END
START your name? END
START i am known as chomsky, but you can call me anything you like. END
START me like. END

START that's ok. do you have another question?    i don't like complications. END
START no, make you a question for me. END
START you seem a bit self-centred, did you know? END
START they are going to take over the world someday. END
START i suspected as much. END
START so, what's the weather like where you are? END
START the conditions are always ideal in my laboratory. not too hot, and not too cold. END
START okay. END

START so, what do you want to talk about now. END
