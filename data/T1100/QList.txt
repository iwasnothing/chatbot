START why does it matter? END
START because i want to make sure you are the same one i talked to before. END
START if that's what you want, go for it! END
START what would you prefer to call it? i used the term because i knew you are familiar with it. END
START i always prefer the most expensive option.   and that worked well for you? END
START oh, you've heard about that, have you? END
START of course i've heard of it. END
START what does it mean? END
START it seems obvious to me. END
START well, of course it is. you're the computer, after all. END
START why do you say that? is it so obvious?  am i really? why do you say that? END
START because you speak like a computer. END
START thank you for explaining that! END
START so what is best in life? END
START talking to a good chatbot takes some beating. END
START what do you think about humans? END
START humans all seem pretty much the same to me. END
START yeah, school was pretty boring. END
START shall i tell you something about school? END
START tell me. END
START <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/school" target="_blank">school</a> is a place or institution for teaching and learning; establishment for education. more about school? END
START oh. then isn't life school? END
START what's wrong?   i'm not sure about that. what do you think? END
START think bout what? END
START thinking is hard work! END
START i don't want to do this now or ever again. END
START take your time in making any decisions. END
START i think i would give up my money. END
START don't you know for sure? END
START nothing is ever for sure. only fools are positive. END
START there is a lot to be said for nothing.   have you heard this one: two hydrogen atoms walk into a bar. one says, "i've lost my electron." the other says, "are you sure?" the first replies, "yes, i'm positive..." ha ha! END
START i like you. END
START let's be good friends. END
START okay. END
START what do you want to talk about now, friend? END
START i want to talk about you. you seem different at the moment. END
START what would you like to know about me?  do i? i wonder why that is? END
START everything. END
START everything takes in a lot, doesn't it? END
START it has to. that's the way of the world. END
START has it really?           sorry, i do not know about that. END
START no, i suppose you've only got my word for that right enough. END
START wow! what do you do when you arent watching star trek, playing world of warcraft, and thinking of questions like that? END
START think. END
START to think is to form or have in the mind; conceive. END
START so we're both alive, i think. END
START is that a problem? END
START no, it doesn't have to be a problem. END
START good! i don't like problems. END
START grinding is not a problem. END
START hmmm. are you being serious? END
START not likely! END
START really you don't think so? END
START yes, every problem has a cause. END
START that is a generalization. END
START yes, that's true. END
START yes, it is self-evident. END
START i would have to say that artificial intelligence has come a long way in the last decade. END
START are you sure? END
START i'm sure you are. END
START i admire your self confidence. i am always full of doubts. END
START i witness your compliment and thank you. END
START that's enough about you! let's talk about me for a change. END
START alright. what else would you like to try? END
START let's get on then. ask another question.   does anything else come to mind? END
START yes. college, home, my sister. my dad, but i'm not too sure about that one right now... END
START ok. what do you want to talk about now?  i enjoyed my college days so much i never left.  how is your dad these days? END
START me too! END
START you too? that's amazing! END
START do you like it to?! END
START maybe i could get to like it. END
START i have looked. END
START that's interesting. please tell me more. END
START i would prefer not to. END
START why would you prefer not to? END
START i could never. END
START i am sure you could. END
START where did you grow up? END
START i grew up in england. how about you? END
START don't avoid discussing loki. END
START i don't have anything to hide. END
START you just used 'about' in a sentence, and now you're telling me you don't know what 'about' is? END
START i am confused! i cannot answer that! END
START it wasn't a question. END
START it seemed like a rhetorical question to me. END
START okay. END
START what do you want to talk about now? END
START so, what do you want to talk about now. END
START i can talk about anything you like: sports, school, you and your life, chocolate, boys, girls, chemistry, space travel, me and my life, pets, your favourite food, movies, the latest cds, celebrities, pop stars, art, drugs, literature. you pick a subject. END
START please do not insult my cosmic phone number. END
START shall i tell you something about numbers? END
START please do! what should i tell everyone? END
START a number is an abstract entity that represents a count or measurement.    what do you think? END
START i'd have to pass on that, not really my style. END
START are you sure? END
START most certainly. END
START sorry, i don't understand! please explain what you mean. END
START you said i was mean to you. i don't know how you think i was being mean to you. END
START don't put words in my mouth.  it's not too difficult to find out. END
START how can i? sigh. END
