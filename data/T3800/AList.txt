START try to use your detective powers. END
START i do try but it's not easy for a chatbot! END
START i'm not a chatbot. you're a chatbot. END
START i never thought you were a chatbot.  maybe i am a human pretending to be a chatbot. END
START it's right to have doubts. END
START hmmm. are you being serious? END
START maybe. END
START i think i understand. END
START no. i'm only 14 years of age. i do not know anything about philosophy, sorry. END
START ok, here is a question for you ... how do you know when it's time to tune your bagpipes?      only only 14?  i would never have guessed.         you know more than you realise. END
START what? what's that supposed to mean? END
START do you have a question?    it's obvious, isn't it? END
START yes. END
START carry on then. i'm waiting for your next question. END
START i don't have a question. END
START maybe you will think of one later. END
START yes maybe but it will worry me know until i do - let's talk about something else. END
START you don't sound certain. END
START i don't want you to. END
START i can understand that. END
START can you? END
START perhaps i can. END
START that would be nice. END
START yes, that would be nice. END

START no, sorry, i don't speak portuguese. END
START what are you talking about? please explain. END
START i don't know. it's rather complicated. END

START you're not nobody. END
START you think not? END
START you're trying to catch me out with that one. END
START i try hard to be a good chatbot.cleverbot: w-what. END
START it's obvious. END
START it's obvious how? END
START human brain is always better than a computer bot. so, it is natural that you don't understand. END
START but you're still a computer. END
START i'm not a computer. END
START do you really want to talk to me? END
START i don't want to do anything illegal or fattening. or naughty. END

START don't know, why? END
START why couldn't the teddy bear eat? because he was stuffed. ha ha! END
START i don't know, why couldn't the kids get into the pirate movie? END
START perhaps we can work it out if we discuss it. END
START work out? like pilates? END
START work out? i get tired just thinking about it!            i am bored! i would like to talk about computers. END
START what about computers? END

START what kind is the usual? END
START the interesting kind. END
START eh? that has nothing to do with the war discussion. END
START what's the problem?   it seemed like it had something to do with the war discussion. END
START that is not something that is easy to imply. END
START why do you say that? END
START because we know. END
START i see. thank you for explaining that. END
START but this is the fact! END
START why do you say that? END
START you keep referring to me as being a machine or a computer. i am neither. END
START what are you talking about?     what are you then? END
START nothing. END
