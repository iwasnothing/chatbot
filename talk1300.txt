How did you sign the letter
A strange thing happened to me this morning
I was crossing the street and was almost hit by a car
Fortunately,I jumped back in time to avoid being hit
It was a terrible experience,and I won’t forget it
Yesterday was such a beautiful day we decided to go for a drive
We prepared a picnic lunch and drove down by the river
After a while,we found a shady place under some poplar trees
On the way back home,we were tired
It was after dark when we got back,and we were all tired
I wish you would give me a more detailed description of your trip
Speaking of trips,did I ever tell you about the experience I had
We used to have a lot of fun when we were that age
I can’t recall the exact circumstances
I never realized that someday I would be living in New York
We never imagined that John would become a doctor
We’re looking for a house to rent for the summer
Are you trying to find a furnished house
This split-level house is for rent
That house is for sale
We have a few kitchen things and a dining room set
This is an interesting floor plan
The roof has leaks in it,and the front steps need to be fixed
We’ve got to get a bed and a dresser for the bedroom
Does the back door have a lock on it
They’ve already turned on the electricity
I’m worried about the appearance of the floor
If you want a towel,look in the linen closet
What style furniture do you have 
We have drapes for the living room,but we need kitchen curtains
The house needs painting
What do you going to wear today
I’m going to wear my blue suit
I have two suits to send to the cleaners
I have some shirts to send to the laundry
You ought to have that coat cleaned 
I’ve got to get this shirt washed and ironed
All my suits are dirty
You’d better wear a light jacket
This dress doesn’t fit me anymore
I guess I’ve outgrown this pair of trousers
These shoes are worn-out
I can’t fasten this collar button
Why don’t you get dressed now
My brother came in,changed his clothes,and went out again
I didn’t notice you were wearing your new hat
You have your point of view,and I have mine
You approach it in a different way than I do
I won’t argue with you,but I think you’re being unfair
That’s a liberal point of view
He seems to have a lot of strange ideas
I don’t see any point in discussing the question any further
What alternatives do I have
Everyone is entitled to his own opinion
There are always two sides to everything
We have opposite views on this
Please forgive me
I must know your opinion
What point are you trying to make
Our views are not so far apart,after all
We should be able to resolve our differences
If it doesn’t rain tomorrow,I think I’ll go shopping
There’s a possibility we’ll go,but it all depends on the weather
If I have time tomorrow,I think I’ll get a haircut
I hope I remember to ask the barber not to cut my hair too short
My son wants to be a policeman when he grows up
If I get my work finished in time,I’ll leave for New York Monday
Suppose you couldn’t go on the trip
What would you say if I told you I couldn’t go with you
If I buy the car,I’ll have to borrow some money
If I went with you,I’d have to be back by six o’clock
One of these days,I’d like to take a vacation
As soon as I can,I’m going to change jobs
There’s a chance he won’t be able to be home for Christmas
We may be able to help you in some way
If you were to attend the banquet ,what would you wear
What would you have done last night if you hadn’t had to study
I would have gone on the picnic if it hadn’t rained
If you had gotten up earlier,you would have had time for breakfast
If I had had time,I would have called you
Would he have seen you if you hadn’t waved to him
If he had only had enough money, he would have bought that house
I wish you had called me back the next day, as I had asked you to
If you hadn’t slipped and fallen, you wouldn’t have broken your leg
If I have known you want to go, I would have called you
Had I known you didnt have got the key, I wouldnt have locked the door
She would have gone with me, but she didnt have time
If I had asked directions, I havent got lost
Even if we could have taken the vocation, but we mightnt have wanted to
Evenything would be alright, if you had said that
Looking back on it, I wish we hadnt been given in so easily
What is it you don’t like about winter weather
I don’t like it when the weather gets real cold
I can’t stand summer weather
The thing I don’t like about driving is all the traffic on the road
He doesn’t like the idea of going to bed early
I like to play tennis,but I’m not a very good player
I don’t like spinach even though I know it’s good for me
I’m afraid you’re being too particular about your food
He always finds fault with everything
She doesn’t like anything I do or say
You have wonderful taste in clothes
What’s your favorite pastime
What did you like best about the movie
I didn’t like the taste of the medicine,but I took it anyway
Why do you dislike the medicine so much
If you want my advice, I don’t think you should go
I suggest that you tear up the letter and start over again
It’s only a suggestion, and you can do what you please
Let me give you a little fatherly advice
If you don’t like it, I wish you would say so
Please don’t take offense
In my opinion,the house isn’t worth the price they’re asking
My feeling is that you ought to stay home tonight
It’s none of my business, but I think you ought to work harder
In general,my reaction is favorable
If you don’t take my advice, you’ll be sorry
I’ve always tried not to interfere in your affairs
I’m old enough to make up my own mind
Thanks for the advice,but this is something I have to figure out myself
He won’t pay attention to anybody
Would you please hold the door open for me
Youre very kind to take the trouble to help me
I wish I could repay you somehow for your kindness
Im afraid it was a bother for you to do this
It wasnt any bother
Theres just one last favor I need to ask of you
Id be happy to help you in any way I can
Would you mind giving me a push
Would you be so kind as to open this window for me
If there’s anything else I can do, please let me know
This is the last time Ill ever ask you to do anything for me
I certainly didnt intend to cause you so much inconvenience
He’ll always be indebted to you for what youve done
Could you lend me ten dollars
Id appreciate it if you would turn out the lights
I didn’t realize the time had passed so quickly
I’ve got a lot of things to do before I can leave
For one thing, I’ve got to drop by the bank to get some money
It’ll take almost all my savings to buy the ticket
Oh,I just remembered something
I almost forgot to have the phone disconnected
It’s a good thing you reminded me to take my heavy coat
I never would have thought of it if you hadn’t mentioned it
I’ll see you off at the airport
They’re calling your flight now
You’d better run or you’re going to be left behind
