   I Will, Love Hurts, Sand and Water, Oh Carol, As Usual, You were always on my mind, There goes my heart, Bobby’s Girl, It started all over again, A forever kind of love, Big Spender, Shut up and Kiss me, Another Saturday Night, My eyes adored you, You’ve got a friend, They can’t take that away from me, The Wanderer, You got what it takes, December 1963, I won’t send roses, Dream Lover, Crying, Rip it up
 He and his wife have split up
  The wife of the above
 Divorced from his wife, now single, a joker and womaniser, or so he thinks
   A friend of Carol and Mary
   Divorced
 Used to live locally but moved away, but recently returned
   Recently widowed and still devastated by her loss
  Single
 A young James Simpson and a young Carol Wadsworth (nee Jones)  (each have one song), Carol’s Mum and Dad, a Vicar, two mourners, a man called Martin, a barman and a waiter
 The set is a bar, a singles bar where people gather who have no partner for one reason or another
 Where do you think you are going young lady?
 Just out with the girls from school, shan’t be long
 Well it had better not be with that waste of space from the council estate again, we told you last week that you had to stop seeing him but Mrs
 We were only talking; he was telling me he plans to go to college and then university when he gets his GCE’s
 College? University? More like Borstal!! No one off that estate ever made anything of their lives; half of them are on the dole, the other half are a bunch of thieves
 Steady on Brenda, a lot of the men on that estate work with me at the factory
 Not with you Derek, for you, you’re the foreman not a labourer
 Well James isn’t going to work at the factory; he’s going to be a high flyer in the city
 The only way he will fly high is from the end of a rope
 Now you’ve gone too far Brenda, enough
 (Excitedly) Edward Wadsworth?  Charles Wadsworth son? The one who owns Wadsworth’s Engineering? Oh Carol that would be a fantastic match for you, married to Edward you would be made for life
 For God’s sake Brenda, they are only kids, Carol is barely fifteen yet and you are marrying her off
 I was only seventeen when I married you
 (Softly) But we didn’t have a lot of options
 Derek!!!
 Its okay mum, I knew you had to get married, I can count
 Don’t be so cheeky young lady; I married your mother because I loved her
 I’m sorry daddy; I didn’t mean to be disrespectful
 Apologises accepted, but mind what you say in future
 (Sadly) Can I go out now?
 Of course you can, but remember what we’ve said, if you see this James character you end it, or I will
 If you defy us
 She won’t will you love?
 No daddy, I won’t, I promise
 (Noticing Carol is upset) Are you okay?
 No I’m not; mummy and daddy say I have to stop seeing you
 Why? We’ve done nothing wrong
 It’s where you live, what you are
 What’s that supposed to mean? Oh I get it; I’m not good enough for their precious daughter, or have you just found someone else?
 Of course there’s no one else I’m so sorry, I really like you a lot but I can’t disobey my parents
 I’ll bet they have someone else lined up already
 It’s not like that at all, I don’t care who or what you are, I love you but I can’t go against my parent’s wishes
 Like, love?  Which one is it? I know how I feel, you’re the only one for me, I love you and I always will
 We’re too young to be in love, it’s just infatuation, we will get over it
 That’s mummy and daddy talking, tell me you don’t love me, tell me to go and I’ll leave now and never come back
 I don’t want you to go but what can I do, we can hardly run away together can we? I do love you but it has to end, we have no option
 (Angrily)You mean you have no option; you want to keep your nice middle class lifestyle so I have to go
 James!
 I’m sorry, I didn’t mean that, I know it has to end but one day I’ll be worthy of you, even in the eyes of your parents
 I thought love made you happy, but it doesn’t, love hurts
 Several people are already present when Anne and her teenage son Roy enter with the Vicar
 It was a lovely service Vicar, I can’t thank you enough
 I am only sorry I didn’t know your husband better, he seemed such a fine man and I only ever heard good things about him
 He was a lovely man; I really don’t know how I’ll cope without him
 I know it’s a cliché, but time is a great healer
 But how do I cope now? (She starts to cry and Roy holds her)
 It will be okay mum, I’ll look after you, I’ll stay here and get a job
 You will not, you’ll go back to Cambridge and make your father proud of you; you’ll make me proud of you too
 Just remember I am always available if you need me, day or night
 Fine man Vicar, he will be missed at the factory, he was just getting into the swing of the job and everyone liked him, no airs and graces like some southerners
 It is a real tragedy, they’ve only been up here a few months and some drunken idiot drives straight into him, and on the wrong side of the road I hear
 Rather an unchristian attitude, we are all God’s children after all
 Sorry Vicar; but it is so wrong that a decent man’s life can be snuffed out by some stupid drunken yob
 Hardly a yob, his father’s a local magistrate
 He’s still a yob in my eyes
 (To Robert)
 He was my boss for God’s sake even if it was only for a few months; you didn’t seriously think I could come on my own?
 Well you do virtually everything else without me; I hardly see nowadays you’re always at work or off to some conference or other
 You know very well her name is Alisha and I couldn’t do my job without her
 You said the same thing last year, but nothing has changed, I sometimes think you love your job more than me
 I promise, this time it will be different, this contract may be the answer to all the company’s problems
 (Sarcastically)
 Sorry to disturb you here Bob but your mobile is switched off and I have just had a message that Alan Cameron from Caledonian Investments he wants to talk to you urgently, some problem has come up with the contract and he wants to sort it out today so it can be signed and sealed by next weekend
 Trip to Scotland? You never mentioned any trip to Scotland
 No, of course not, I knew you would react like this so I thought it would be best if I didn’t mention it
 Mrs Murray I don’t know what makes you think there is anything going on between Bob, I mean Mr
 If you think I believe that rubbish you must think I am really stupid
 I swear there is nothing going on between me and Alisha, look, we have to go, we can talk about this later, I’ll explain everything when I get home
 There is nothing more to say, go and don’t come back!
 The action moves to Roy and Anne)
 Mum, are you going to stay around here? After all you hardly know anyone
 I suppose I could go back to Sussex but it is so expensive down there, I’m not sure I can afford it
 You could move down to Cambridge and stay with me
 I don’t think so, you will be very busy with your studying and I wouldn’t want to cramp your style, you don’t want your mum looking over your shoulder when you are planning a night on the town
 I’m sure I’ll be alright; I have my memories to keep me warm
 Not many in tonight, wonder why I bother sometimes
 You bother because you have nothing else to do, and neither do I
 I suppose, say isn’t that Jane Rogers, (slowly) no, but it looks like her
 God Bobby how far back are you going now? I know Mary hurt you when she dumped you but for God’s sake get over it and move on
 I have moved on, I had to; she kicked me out of the house
 How did I ever let you talk me into coming here, I got rid of one useless man, I certainly don’t want another one
 We didn’t force you; let’s face it you were bored witless staying in every night
 I was not; I am really into Casualty and Ant and Dec
  Give it a chance, it’s early, it picks up after nine, well sometimes it does
 Bobby! I’m not stopping, I’m going
 Of course not we’re not stupid, well we are, but not that stupid
 You can’t go now; it will look like you are afraid of being in the same room as him
 I’m not afraid of him; I just don’t want anything more to do with the useless, lying, cheating, swine
 I knew he was useless a liar and a swine all men are, but I never knew he cheated on you? 
 Oh he denied it, but there’s no way he was just working overtime every other night
 Come on let’s get a seat and I’ll get the drinks in, you don’t have to go anywhere near him
 No, I’m going; this has ruined any chance of me having a good night out
 Are you going to be good or do we have to tie you to that chair?
 Okay, leave me alone; just don’t expect me to have a good time
 We won’t
 (To the barman)
 Certainly madam
 No thank you
 Well if it isn’t Carol Jones as was, what the hell are you doing in a place like this?
 Get lost John; you tried that line three weeks ago
 Did I? I must be losing it
 You never had it to start with
 You love me really don’t you?
 Dream on!
 Oh I do, every night
 That’s all it’s ever going to be boy, a dream! You really are a fool
 Sings “Oh Carol” in a jokey way)
 Well if it’s not Barbara Smith! It is! As I live and breathe
 We come in here every week and you come out with the same inane rubbish every week, no wonder Amy left you
 She left me because she was jealous of all the girls wanting my body
 The only women who wanted your body were the desperate dames you got off with in places like this
 You say the nicest things
 Why don’t you just shut up for a while, you’re even getting on my nerves now, never mind those two
 Sorry, just trying to lighten the mood a little, nothing wrong with a bit of banter with the opposite sex
 I was trying to give us the lifestyle I thought she wanted; I spent thousands on jewellery, and the house, everything any normal woman could ever want
 Did you ever ask her if that was what she wanted? 
 Of course it’s what she wanted; she just didn’t like what it cost to get them
 There was nothing wrong with her, look, it’s like when you go into a restaurant and order the best steak in the house, then a man at the next table has the fish and you think “That looks nice, wish I’d ordered that”
 The girls are right you do talk a lot of drivel
 My name is Chris and I am your waiter for tonight
 Can I have a white wine spritzer please? Chris? Don’t I know you? 
 Yes madam I work for your husband, well I used to work for him, I ‘m still with the company I just work in here part time to earn a bit extra, helps with the bills
 It’s very kind of you to say so
 So it’s just a white wine sprirtzer?
 (Absentmindedly) Oh, yes
 He sees her immediately and she sees him, he keeps staring she avoids his gaze a little confused by it)
 Who’s the new girl in the corner? (Speaking to the barman)
 Not seen her before, she came in on her own
 Not many come here on their own; usually have a girlfriend or two in tow
 Actually I don’t think she realises its singles bar
 How could she not know? It’s called “Singles” for God’s sake!
 Probably thought it referred to the drinks
 You know Sam; you say some daft things at times
 Yes, why?
 I’ll pay for that
 Certainly sir, and thank you, but actually I think you’re wasting your time
 Why’s that? 
 Well sir, I used to work for her husband, he died a few months ago, really close they were, really close
 Thanks for the info, but give her the drink anyway, you never know
 Okay, but you’re wasting your time
 He points to Adam and whispers something to Anne, then he places down the drink and returns to the bar)
 What did she say? 
 “She said “thanks” but she would pay for it herself
 (Absentmindedly) “No, keep it
 (She starts to put her purse away and a picture of her late husband falls out
 Okay, what did he say?
 Nothing, he doesn’t know you’re here, yet
 He always did walk around with his eyes shut, he didn’t notice me when he was at home, I’m not surprised he hasn’t noticed me in here
 Sounds to me like you want him to see you
 Of course not, but for heaven’s sake I ‘m only 30 feet away!!
 Keep your voice down or he will hear you if he doesn’t see you
 This is ridiculous, he’s bound to see you soon enough, why not approach him and get it over with
 I will not! If he wants to talk to me he can come to me
 But he doesn’t realise you’re here
 Oh to hell with it
 Just going to the loo
 So this is what you get up to now, can’t get enough from that floozie at work so you come here
 Whoa, what are you on about and never mind me, what the hell are you doing here? 
 That’s it, avoid the question
 I am not avoiding the question; I’m asking you a better one
 You think I believe that, I’ll bet you’ve been in here every weekend since I threw you out
 Look, if you don’t believe me ask John
 (Rather too quickly)  Never sir
 Men! You ALL stick together and lie through your teeth
 I am sick of him and his lies; I could kill him, the sooner my marriage is over the better
 That’s the trouble with marriage; it’s just like a game of cards
 How do you mean?
 Well you start off with two Hearts and a Diamond and end up wishing for a Club and a Spade!
 Wife?  (John nods) Thought so
 Might as well, same again
 He is well dressed, suit, the lot He strolls to the bar and orders a drink)
 Large Bacardi and Coke please
 Hi
 Yes, how did you know?
 Just a guess, you looked a bit lost
 I am a bit, though I used to live locally
 (With a sudden recognition) I thought I recognised you; it’s James, James Simpson, where the hell have you been?
 Oh, here and there
 Well here and there doesn’t seem to have done you much harm
 No
 Nice, I take it that if you’re in here you’re not attached
 No, I was for a while but it didn’t work out
 Sorry to hear that
 You?
 To be honest I’m not quite sure
  Pardon?
 Well technically I am still married, but I won’t be for long if the wife has her way
 Sounds like we’re in the same boat, Saturday night and no date
   I got in town a month ago  I've seen a lot of girls since then,  If I could meet 'em I could get 'em  But as yet I haven't met 'em  Thats how I'm in the state I'm in
 Have another drink
 Thanks, I will
 The scene moves to the girls)
 Come on you two, drink up, my round
 Two white wines and a whisky and soda barman if you please
 (Speaking to James)
 Rich? We don’t get “rich” in here very often
 Give it a rest Barbara; he’s only just got back in town
 Back? You mean you used to live around here and you came back, are you insane?
 To be honest it feels good to be back
 There’s no accounting for taste, mind you, yours is suspect by the company you’re keeping now
 See him at the bar with those two, he’s loaded and he reckons he used to live around here, but I don’t recognise him
 Oh but I do
 Yes, now you mention it I do recognise him; mind you he’s changed a lot
 That was just kids stuff; we were only fourteen or fifteen
 First love, always the hardest to forget
  It was never serious, well not that serious
 What happened, who dumped who?
 It was my Mum really, said he was a waste of space and wouldn’t let him in the house
 I bet she would now; he can come home with me anytime
 You’d have anybody in trousers
 Not true, I’d much rather have them out of their trousers
 How did Danny ever put up with you so long? How many men did you have whilst you were married to the poor sap?
 Not as many as I would have liked
 You promised it was for better or worse
  That was before I knew how “worse” it was going to be!
 Have you got any intention of settling down again with just one man?
 No intention whatsoever, but I might make an exception in his case
 You really are incorrigible! (They all laugh)
 Adam approaches and speaks to her)
 I do hope I didn’t offend you offering that drink, I was just trying to be friendly
 No, I wasn’t offended but I would rather buy my own thank you
 Do you mind if I join you? No strings and I won’t try to buy you another drink
 To be honest I’d rather you didn’t, I’d rather be on my own
 (Sitting down)
 I suppose not
 I find that difficult to believe, a lovely lady like you
 Look if you must know I lost my husband a few months ago and this is the first time I have been out since the funeral
 (Feigning surprise) Oh I am sorry; I shouldn’t have intruded on you
 No, stay, you weren’t to know
 (Sitting down again)
 (She smiles and they begin to chat)
  (To James)
 I didn’t mind, it was fun in a strange way
 Used to be, Carol Wadsworth now
 Married? 
  Course not; she wouldn’t be in here if she was
 Well you’re married and so is your wife and you’re both in here
 Like I said, that’s just a technicality
 Anyway, How come you know Carol, and why so interested?
 Oh I just knew her at school; we went out for a while
 Funny, I seem to find that, no matter how the years unwind,  still I reminisce about the girI I miss and the love I left behind
  (To Mary)
 I’ve told you why
 You only told us you thought he was having an affair, of which you have no proof whatsoever as far as we know
 God Barbara, you at least should now what men are like, you’ve had enough of them!
 That’s not a nice thing to say to a friend, it’s true, but it’s not a nice thing to say
 I “dumped him” as you put it because he was hardly ever at home and when he was he was “somewhere else”
 In fairness to the man he did work every hour God sent
 That was his story, but I think he was with that secretary of his, that’s why he was always so tired
 Okay, give us one bit of proof that he was having it away with her or anyone else?
 Oh do shut up!!
 Thought so, no proof whatsoever
 I hate to say it but Barbara has a point
 Shut up both of you
 (To Barbara)
)  When people ask of me,  “What would you like to be now that you’re not a kid anymore?” (You’re not a kid anymore
 Thank you for staying, I’ve enjoyed talking to you, it was nice to talk about Alan, I hope I didn’t bore you?
 Of course not, it sounds like he was a great guy
 Oh he was, everyone liked Alan, he got on with everyone
 Yeh, you said
 I did bore you, I knew I had
 No you didn’t; but you did just talk about Alan, what about you?
 Me? Oh I’m not very interesting, just a housewife and mother, I have son, at University, he’s at Cambridge
 (Impressed) Cambridge, but I didn’t mean that, I meant what do you like, what do you want to do with the rest of your life?
 I did like to go to the theatre, I loved the Ballet and Alan always came with me, though I had to keep nudging him to keep him awake
 But what now, what are you planning to do now you’re on your own?
 I have no idea, I have not even thought of the future
 Sounds to me that you are giving up on life
 I have no friends to speak of up here, but I do like the area
  Me? I’m a travelling salesman, and no, I don’t travel in ladies underwear, I sell computer software
 Tell me about her
 Oh what a night)
 Late December back in '63
 Sounds like you still love her
 Maybe, all I know is I’ve never felt the same about anyone else
 Is that why you chase all the women, don’t look so innocent, the waiter told me all about you
 Never trust a waiter
 I thought you might be fun, and you were
 I take it you want me to go now?
 Only if you want to
 (Strangely subdued)
 Yes please
 The scene moves to the bar again where James has rejoined John and Bobby)
 (Looking towards Anne and Adam)
 Who him?  Thinks he’s God’s gift that one
 And everyone knows it’s you that’s God’s gift
 Not my fault the ladies love me
 Seems to me that Carol and Barbara have no problem ignoring your charms
 Oh I’m not after Carol; its just banter, but I have to say I do quite fancy Barbara
 (Sarcastically)
 That might be fun, playing “Ring a Ring a Roses” especially the “we all fall down bit”
 You’re more likely to catch a cold from the “Atishoo, Atishoo” bit!
 What about you Bobby, you and Mary I mean, any chance of you two getting back together?
 I doubt it, I made too many mistakes, I didn’t show her how much I loved her enough, well, that’s what she said
 If you think you can change why don’t you tell her?
 I doubt she would listen
 A wise man once said “You only regret what you don’t do” and I think he was right
 Are you referring to me and Mary or you and Carol?
 You and Mary of course
 It sounded to me like you have some regrets too
 Not really, it was too long ago, we were only kids
 Are you trying to persuade me or yourself?
 I’m not trying to persuade anyone of anything, I just think you should give your marriage another try
 You’re right on the first part, not so sure on the second
 Like James said, worth a try what have you got to lose?
 I do have some pride left
 Great stuff, “pride” keeps you warm at night I hear
 I’ve just been
  Me too but we’ll pretend we’ve got prostate trouble and go again!
 (To the barman, pointedly ignoring Bobby)
 I see you still drink your whisky without the ice
 At least you noticed something from when we were together, anything else come to mind?
 (He takes a deep breath)
 I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of times you said that to me in the last two years
 I thought you knew how I felt about you
 Women like to hear it Bobby, regularly, I hardly ever saw you never mind heard you
 Be fair Mary, I was working a hell of a lot to pay for everything
 You said you were working, but you were always with that secretary of yours; don’t try to tell me there was nothing going on
 I swear there was nothing going on between me and Alisha; she’s as happily married as I thought I was
 Even if I believed you, which I still don’t, (Though she obviously does) you ruined our marriage, you were never there
 If you don’t believe anything else please believe me when I say I always loved you and still do
 (Picking up her drinks)
 No I don’t, and I don’t think you do either
  What’s going on, we saw you talking to Bobby, I thought you were going to ignore him?
 (Confused)
 Okay which one is it, you are or you were?
 I was
 Yes, I remember, he worked all hours God sent to give you all the good things in life; I should be so lucky to find such an inconsiderate man
 You make it sound so perfect but not having anyone to talk to night after night is no fun I can tell you
 You don’t think we don’t both know that?
 I’m sorry, of course you do but it’s different when you’re supposed to have a man in your life
 Maybe that’s true, but technically you still do have a man in your life and it seems with a little effort you could still have one in reality
 I don’t want my boring old fart back but I wouldn’t mind someone to cuddle up to every now and then
 You said you weren’t interested in finding a partner, you said you just wanted to play the field
 I lied
 What I have is just a dream, you could have reality
 What time is it?
 It’s only ten fifteen, but I’ve had enough tonight, shall we go?
 Yes I’ve had enough too, how about you Mary?
 (Somewhat reluctantly)
 Hey Mary, can I offer you all a lift
 Thanks Martin, it’s not out of your way is it?
 No, it’s right on your route
 Yes, just around the corner from me
 Great, come on, I’m parked just across the road
 I can’t believe we’ve been seeing each other for over a month and Carol and Mary haven’t found out
 Would it be so terrible if they did?
 I would rather keep it to ourselves, at least for a while
 I don’t see why?
 It’s just I don’t want to risk spoiling what we have
 Why, what do we have?
 That’s just it, I don’t know what we have, do you?
 Well we’ve been seeing each other virtually every day for nearly six weeks and we still seem to enjoy each other’s company and the other night was wonderful
  It was wasn’t it and you’re right we do get on well, but it still doesn’t mean we should get too involved
 If what we‘ve been doing for the last few weeks is not getting too involved I don’t know what is
 (Exasperated)  Oh I don’t know, it’s just it has happened so quickly, we haven’t had time to think it all through
 So what are you saying, do you want to end it?
 No, of course not, it’s just I am worried we are getting carried away; we’re acting like a couple of kids
 I see nothing wrong with acting like a couple of kids, I have had to grow old, I refuse to grow up
 That’s the difference between us, I have grown up, I’m an adult and I feel I should act like one
 I was only kidding about not growing up, but surely we have a right to fall in love no matter how old we are?
 Is that how you feel; are you in love with me?
 Well if I am completely honest at this moment I can’t say I am totally sure, but I am 90% sure and I would like the opportunity to add the other 10%
 It’s that 10% I am worried about; it’s why I want to wait awhile before saying anything to the others
 Okay, we will keep quiet about it for a bit longer if that’s what you want
 It is, and thank you for being so understanding
 If it’s what you want that’s what we’ll do, now let’s get to the restaurant, I’m starving
 The girls are already in the bar, Bobby and John enter)
 See, I told you she would be in again
 (Sarcastically)
 Well Barbara said he was just giving them all a lift home, he works with Mary at the Bank and he’s Gay for God’s sake
  Okay, but it doesn’t mean she’s in here to see me
  Err
 No you damn well didn’t and you know you didn’t
 Nothing serious, but I’m living in hopes
 The mind boggles
 Be fair, you don’t know all the rumours are true and let’s face it I’ve been no angel
 If only half the rumours are true I still think even you’ve bitten off more than you can chew
  That’s easy, I‘ve become a vegetarian; seriously she’s nothing like you’d imagine when you’re on your own with her, she’s clever and funny and really great to be with
 Oh my God, it sounds like you’re smitten!
 I am a bit, but honestly she can be really nice
 I’ll just have to take your word for that
  (Noticing that Mary and Carol are heading for the loo)
 Oh don’t mind me, I’m used to rejection
 Hi
 Yes, of course, but I haven’t told Carol and Mary yet, have you told Bobby?
  Well yes, it just slipped out
 Bang goes our agreement to keep it to ourselves for now
 Sorry, forgive me?
 I suppose I’ll have to
 Is that what I am, a shock? 
  Not you personally, just the idea that I’m going out with someone, not just a casual someone
 It’s nice to now I’m not just a casual someone, whatever that is
 You know what I mean
 If you mean someone who’s serious about you and wants a serious relationship, then yes, I do
 Well yes, but let’s not rush things
 We’re a bit old for taking our time, we’re not kids anymore
 What does that mean exactly?
 I’m saying I’ve acquired that extra 10%, I love you and I want to spend what’s left of my life with you
 My God, I didn’t think you were THAT serious!!
  Well I am, is it a problem? I get it; I’m not good enough for you
 Where did that come from? When have I ever said that?
 Well what are you saying?
 I’m saying I was not expecting all this to happen so quickly, what am I saying; I never expected it to happen at all at my age
 You’re not that old, and anyway it confirms what I said, we are too old to be taking too much time over this
 If I knew the question I might answer it
 It’s simple and old fashioned, will you marry me?
 But we hardly know each other
 What’s to know, I’m divorced, your divorced, we both have grown up children who have fled the nest, we’ve both been lonely and now we’re not, and I love you, what more do you need to know?
 It’s so sudden, I can’t take it in
 You do think I’m not good enough for you, that’s it isn’t it?
 For the last time, that’s not it, I think you’re wonderful
 So what’s your answer?
 (She sings “You’ve got what it takes”)
 And you don't look like a movie star and on your money we won't get far
 Is that a yes? 
 Of course it is you fool!!
 They are joined by a stunned Bobby)
 What the hell is going on?  (She pulls John away from Barbara
 Its okay, it’s okay
 Like hell it is, he can’t go around just snogging any woman he likes, we should call the police
 You don’t understand, I was kissing him
 (Incredulously)
 Because I love him
 (Incredulously)
 You heard you big lummox, I love you
 (To Carol)
 Of course not
 Don’t look at me; I’m as dumbfounded as you
 Look, we met up a few times and we realised what we felt for each other was real so we
  John, just shut up and do what you’re good at
 Well damn me, I think I’ve seen everything now
 (Still with his arm around Barbara)
 He sees the group and joins them)
 Looks like I’ve missed something, what’s going on?
 Barbara and Bobby, that’s what’s going on
 No kidding, good on you two
 I’m not so sure
 Oh don’t be such a killjoy, when you think about it they’re made for each other, (Pause) just like us
 Since when have we been made for each other?
 Since the day we met and you know it
 I do not know it
  (He looks her very closely in the eye and slowly and tenderly kisses her)
 I suppose I do
 (To James)
 Would that be such a bad thing? 
 No I suppose it wouldn’t
 Anyway you’ve got a man in your life now haven’t you?
 Oh you mean Martin, no he’s not my boyfriend, we just meet up occasionally for a drink after work, there’s nothing going on
 My mistake, I thought when I saw you two together last night you were an item, I hope you didn’t mind my butting in but I was glad to see you again
 No I didn’t mind at all, it was just we had a table booked, we had to go
 Oh that’s okay, it’s your life, I don’t want to appear nosey
 I’d never think that of you, even after all this time I hope we are still friends
 Definitely, I will always be your friend
 Close your eyes and think of me and soon I will be there to brighten up even your darkest nights
 That might have been us a few years ago if it hadn’t been for your Mum
 White wine please
 (To Barman)
 Don’t blame her too much, she was only doing what she thought was right
 I suppose so; I wasn’t much of a catch for her only daughter back then was I?
 You know what parents are like; they just want the best for their kids
 True, I would have probably done the same in her position
 Do you have kids?
 No, my ex wife and I were only together a couple of years; it was never going to work out
 Just one, Brian, he’s in Dubai working for a Bank
 So you’re on your own now?
 Well not really, Mary and Barbara are always around, though I’m not sure how much I’ll see of them now
 I’m sure they won’t desert you, they’re your friends and you know I am too
 You’ve only just got here, can’t you stay for a while, or is she the type who dislikes it when people are late, I know I do
 To be honest I don’t know, only just met her this week, she works on the reception at my offices
 (Hiding her disappointment that it is a woman he is meeting)
 That’s true
 I hadn’t thought of that, I suppose you’re right, but I will probably see you around, this town is not very big
 That’s very true
  (She sings “Crying”)
 White wine spritzer? 
 Yes please
  (To the Barman)
 You never say please do you?
  Don’t I? Does it matter?
 There’s no charge for manners, that’s what Alan used to say
 He really meant a lot to you didn’t he?
 Well, yes, we were together a long time
 Are you sure he was as wonderful as you are painting him?
  I don’t know what you mean
 Well he sounds so bloody perfect, no man’s that good
 But Alan was, he was lovely, everyone liked him
  Not everyone, he’s getting on my nerves for a start
 Whatever do you mean?
  In your eyes he’s so damn perfect no other man could ever aspire to match him
 I don’t expect anyone to match him; I just thought I could find someone a bit like him
 So why take up with the likes of me? Because I’m nothing like him
 Because I thought you were nice and, well I thought you might be fun
 And am I?
 Well not when you’re like this
 I’ll tell you exactly what I’m like
 I knew that’s what you were like, but you’ve been lovely with me, attentive and considerate, I thought we were friends
 You just don’t get it do you?
 Get what?
 Look, I set out to get you into bed, then I had second thoughts, I have no idea why, well I do, you’re just too nice for the likes of me to take advantage of
 You make me sound like a Nun
 You’re not a Nun, but you’re used to something better than me, you’re used to being given flowers, presents, all the things nice guys give to nice girls
 I thought
 Don’t think anything
  What if I said I didn’t want roses?
 That’s the trouble, you do, and you deserve them
 Chris realises something has happened and comes over)
 Are you okay Mrs
  Thanks Chris but no, there’s nothing anyone can do
 Are you sure?
 Yes, I’m sure
 (Taking out her picture of Alan)
 How long does it take to get a marriage licence?
 I have no idea, but let’s get one as quick as we can before we both have an attack of common sense
 I agree, let’s keep common sense out of this
)  Everyone apart from John, Barbara, James and Anne are already in the club listening to the band play some soft, quiet music
 Three cheers for the happy couple, hip hip, hooray, hip hip, hooray, hip hip, hooray
 Is anyone going to get me a drink?  (Champagne is handed to both Barbara and John)
 I’d rather have a pint
 Philistine!!
 Yes, but I’m your Philistine
 Yes you are, so do as you’re told and drink the champagne
 (Feigning subservience)
 (Directed at the band)
 Certainly Madam, what do you fancy?
 Well not that dire stuff you’ve been playing, come on let’s Rip it Up
 Well, it's Saturday night and I just got paid, Fool about my money, don't try to save, My heart says go go, have a time, Saturday night and I'm feelin' fine,  I'm gonna rock it up, I'm gonna rip it up, I'm gonna shake it up, gonna ball it up, I'm gonna rock it up, and ball tonight
 At the back James appears and Carol sees him and the curtain closes)
